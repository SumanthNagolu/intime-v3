**Issue ID:** CAMPAIGNS-02
**Created:** 2025-12-09
**Status:** Open
**Priority:** High
**Type:** Functionality
**Reporter:** User

---

## Summary

The "+ NEW CAMPAIGN" button on the Campaigns list page does nothing when clicked. There is no navigation, no modal/panel opening, and no console errors. This completely blocks users from creating new campaigns through the UI.

## Location

- **Screen**: Campaigns list page
- **URL**: `/employee/crm/campaigns`
- **Component**: "+ NEW CAMPAIGN" button (top-right corner, black button)
- **Action**: Clicking the button

## Problem Description

When a user clicks the "+ NEW CAMPAIGN" button on the campaigns list page, absolutely nothing happens. The button appears to be rendered correctly (visible, styled as a black button with white text), but clicking it produces no response whatsoever.

## Expected Behavior

Clicking the "+ NEW CAMPAIGN" button should initiate the campaign creation flow - either by:
- Navigating to a campaign creation form/wizard
- Opening an inline panel for campaign creation
- Opening a modal dialog

## Current Behavior

- Button click produces no visible response
- No navigation occurs
- No panel or modal opens
- No console errors or warnings appear
- No network activity is triggered

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to `/employee/crm/campaigns`
2. Locate the "+ NEW CAMPAIGN" button in the top-right corner
3. Click the button
4. Observe that nothing happens

## Evidence

### Screenshots
Campaign list page showing the non-functional button:
- Screenshot shows the Campaigns page with 4 existing campaigns
- "+ NEW CAMPAIGN" button is visible and appears enabled
- Button styling appears correct (black background, white text)

### Console Logs
No errors reported - user confirmed no console activity when clicking.

### Network Errors
Not applicable - no network requests are triggered.

## Impact

- **Severity**: Blocking
- **Affected Users**: All users who need to create campaigns (TA Specialists, Recruiters)
- **Workaround**: None known - cannot create new campaigns via UI

## Technical Context

- **Related Files**: TBD - requires investigation
- **Possible Cause**: Button onClick handler may be missing or not properly connected

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clicking "+ NEW CAMPAIGN" button initiates campaign creation flow
- [ ] User can successfully create a new campaign
- [ ] Issue no longer reproducible

---

## Notes

- The button is visually rendered correctly, suggesting the issue is with the click handler rather than rendering
- This is a high-priority issue as it completely blocks campaign creation functionality
