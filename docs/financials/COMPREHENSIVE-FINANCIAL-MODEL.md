```
Target Students: 500 (start) → 1,000 (end)

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):
  - Month 1-3: 100 students × $99 = $9,900/month
  - Month 4-6: 300 students × $99 = $29,700/month
  - Month 7-9: 600 students × $99 = $59,400/month
  - Month 10-12: 1,000 students × $99 = $99,000/month

```

**Year 2-5 Growth:**

### 2. Recruiting Services 🎯

#### Pricing Model
| Placement Type | Fee Structure | Average Fee | Volume Target (Year 1) |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|------------------------|

| **Contract-to-Hire** | 15-25% | $12K | 30 placements |
| **Direct Hire** | 18-25% | $18K | 30 placements |

#### Revenue Calculation (Per Pod)

**Pod Structure:** 1 Senior + 1 Junior
**Sprint Target:** 2 placements per 2-week sprint
**Annual Target:** 50 placements per pod (accounting for ramp-up)

```
Year 1: 2 Pods × 50 placements × $15K average = $1.5M
Year 2: 5 Pods × 52 placements × $16K average = $4.16M
Year 3: 10 Pods × 52 placements × $17K average = $8.84M
Year 4: 20 Pods × 52 placements × $18K average = $18.72M
Year 5: 30 Pods × 52 placements × $20K average = $31.2M
```

#### Cost Structure (Per Pod)
| Cost Item | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Senior salary | $8,000 | $96,000 |
| Junior salary | $4,000 | $48,000 |
| AI automation | $100 | $1,200 |

| Office/overhead | $1,000 | $12,000 |
| **Total Cost** | **$13,600** | **$163,200** |

**Gross Margin per Pod:** $1.5M - $163K = $1,336,800 (89% margin)

#### Cross-Pollination Revenue
Every recruiting interaction generates:
- **20% Academy leads** → 10 students/year × $99 × 12 = $11,880
- **15% Bench opportunities** → 5 consultants × $10K = $50,000
- **10% Cross-border** → 2 placements × $20K = $40,000
- **Total Cross-Pollination:** $101,880 per pod per year
