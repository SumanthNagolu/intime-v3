## 70-Member Team: Monthly Cost Estimate

| Department | Headcount | Monthly cost |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Executive layer | 4 | 3.5-5.5L |
| Supply arm | 25 | 5.5-8L |
| Demand arm | 20 | 5-7.5L |
| Training arm | 12 | 3-4.5L |
| Support functions | 8 | 2-3L |
| **TOTAL** | **70** | **19-28.5L/month** |

Add ~25% for incentives, tools, office, and overhead = **~24-35L/month**

**Break-even math:**
- Average margin per consultant: $1,500-$2,500/month
- Need 15-20 consultants on billing to cover costs
- Target: 100-300 consultants on billing = strong profitability
- At 150 consultants avg: Revenue ~$300K, Margin ~$150K (~1.2Cr) vs Cost ~30L = **90L profit/month**
