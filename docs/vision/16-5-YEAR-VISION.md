## Market Expansion

### Year 1-2: Guidewire Only

**Total Market:** $500M
**InTime Share:** 0.6% → 1.4%

**Strategy:**
- Dominate one niche before expanding
- Build deep expertise (Guidewire-only focus = competitive moat)
- Establish brand: "The Guidewire talent experts"

### Year 3: Multi-Vertical (Salesforce, Workday)

**Total Market:** $500M (Guidewire) + $1B (Salesforce) + $500M (Workday) = $2B
**InTime Share:** $12.5M / $2B = 0.6%

**Strategy:**
- Clone model for new verticals (same playbook, different tech)
- Leverage existing platform (IntimeOS, AI mentor, recruiting workflows)
- Cross-sell: Guidewire client also needs Salesforce talent? We do that now!

### Year 4-5: International + Enterprise

**Total Market:** $2B (US) + $500M (UK) + $300M (Canada) + $200M (Australia) = $3B
**InTime Share:** $50M / $3B = 1.7%

**Strategy:**
- International expansion (English-speaking countries first: UK, Canada, Australia)
- Enterprise sales (Fortune 500 have global needs, multi-year contracts)
- Market consolidation (acquire smaller agencies, roll up market)

## Exit Strategy & Valuation

### Valuation Framework

**SaaS Multiples:**
- Recurring revenue: 5-10× ARR
- High growth (100% YoY): 8-12× ARR
- Best-in-class (Rule of 40 > 100): 10-15× ARR

**Staffing Multiples:**
- Traditional: 0.5-1× revenue
- High-growth: 1-2× revenue
- Tech-enabled: 2-4× revenue

**InTime Hybrid (Staffing + SaaS):**
- Blended multiple: 3-6× revenue
- Justification: Recurring revenue (24%), high margins (45%+), AI moat, growth rate (100% YoY)

### Year 5 Valuation Scenarios

**Conservative: $150M** (3× revenue)
- Assumption: Slow growth (30% YoY going forward)
- Multiple: 3× (low end for tech-enabled staffing)
- Founder net worth: $135M (90% ownership, bootstrapped)

**Base Case: $225M** (4.5× revenue)
- Assumption: Moderate growth (50% YoY going forward)
- Multiple: 4.5× (mid-range for hybrid model)
- Founder net worth: $200M (90% ownership)

**Bull Case: $300M** (6× revenue)
- Assumption: High growth (100% YoY going forward)
- Multiple: 6× (high end, justified by Rule of 40 = 145)
- Founder net worth: $270M (90% ownership)

**Strategic Premium: $500M** (10× revenue)
- Assumption: Acquirer sees strategic value (LinkedIn wants talent platform, Guidewire wants vertical integration)
- Multiple: 10× (strategic premium, not public market)
- Founder net worth: $450M (90% ownership)

### Exit Comparison

| Exit Option | Valuation | Founder Payout (90%) | Timeline | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|----------|------|------|
| **IPO** | $150M-$300M | $135M-$270M | Year 5 (2030) | Liquidity, prestige, M&A currency | Public scrutiny, quarterly pressure |
| **Strategic Sale** | $200M-$500M | $180M-$450M | Year 4-5 | Immediate liquidity, no IPO hassle | Lose independence |
| **Stay Private** | N/A | $20M/year dividends | Forever | Full control, annual income | No liquidity event, less scale |

### Recommended Path

**Phase 1 (Year 1-2):** Bootstrap
- Prove model, build cash reserves
- Retain 100% ownership, no dilution
- Month 3: Cash flow positive (no funding needed!)

**Phase 2 (Year 3):** Optional Series A
- Raise $5M at $50M pre-money valuation (10% dilution)
- Use for: M&A, international expansion, IntimeOS scale
- Alternative: Stay bootstrapped (profitable enough to self-fund)

**Phase 3 (Year 5):** Exit Decision
- **If goal is $100M+ net worth:** Bootstrap path ($135M-$270M at IPO, 90% ownership)
- **If goal is $500M+ net worth:** Series A path ($300M-$500M strategic sale, 60-90% ownership)
- **If goal is lifestyle business:** Stay private ($100M+ cumulative dividends over 5 years)
