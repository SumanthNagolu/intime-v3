Most staffing agencies are generalists.

What this means for you:
• Deep candidate network (we know WHO to call)
• Technical expertise (we understand PolicyCenter vs ClaimCenter)
• Faster sourcing (our database has 2,000+ Guidewire professionals)
• Higher quality (many are our own Academy graduates)

## B2B SaaS Launch (Year 2)

### IntimeOS: Platform for Staffing Agencies

**Product Vision:**
```
"The operating system for staffing agencies"

Problem we solve:
├─ Staffing agencies use 10+ tools (ATS, CRM, email, scheduling, etc.)
├─ Manual processes (sourcing, screening, client communication)
├─ No AI automation
└─ Poor visibility (managers can't see team performance)

Our solution:
├─ All-in-one platform (ATS + CRM + AI + Analytics)
├─ AI-powered sourcing and screening
├─ Pod-based workflow (2-person teams)
├─ Real-time dashboards
└─ Price: $1,500/month (vs $10K+ for Bullhorn + other tools)
```

**Target Market:**
```
ICP (Ideal Customer Profile):
├─ Industry: Staffing agencies (any niche)
├─ Size: 5-50 employees
├─ Revenue: $1M-10M/year
├─ Tech stack: Currently using Bullhorn, JobAdder, or spreadsheets
├─ Pain: "Our tools are too expensive and don't talk to each other"
└─ Decision maker: Founder, COO, VP Operations

Market size:
├─ US staffing agencies: 25,000
├─ Our TAM (5-50 employees): 12,000 agencies
├─ SAM (tech-enabled): 3,000 agencies
├─ SOM (Year 2 target): 50 agencies (1.7% market share)
└─ Revenue potential: 50 × $1,500/month × 12 = $900K/year
```
