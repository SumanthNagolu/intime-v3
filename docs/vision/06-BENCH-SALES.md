## Bench Sales Overview

### Mission

> **"Place consultants on bench into projects within 30-60 days, providing income stability and career momentum."**

### What is "Bench"?

**Bench** = Consultants between projects (no current assignment, no income)

**Why Consultants Go on Bench:**
- Previous project ended (client budget ran out, project complete)
- Laid off (company downsizing, economic conditions)
- Chose to leave (toxic work environment, better opportunity elsewhere)
- New to consulting (just graduated, first-time contractor)

### Core Differentiators

1. **Speed:** 30-day average placement (vs 45-60 days industry)
2. **Proactive:** Daily outreach to clients (vs "we'll let you know")
3. **Support:** Weekly check-ins, career coaching (vs ghosting consultants)
4. **Revenue Model:** Ongoing commission (5% of billing) = aligned incentives
5. **Network:** Access to 300+ client relationships (vs consultant's individual network)

### Value Proposition

**For Consultants:**
- **Income:** Get back to work fast (30 days vs 45-60 days = 2 weeks extra income)
- **Career:** Avoid resume gaps, maintain momentum
- **Support:** Not alone (we're actively working to place you)
- **Quality:** Better projects (we pre-vet clients, avoid bad gigs)

**For Business:**
- **Revenue:** $1,130,000 Year 1 (60 placements + commissions)
- **Margin:** 92% gross margin (low cost to serve)
- **Recurring:** Ongoing commissions (consultant works = we earn)
- **Cross-Pollination:** Consultants refer colleagues, become clients (if they start agencies)

---

## 30-60 Day Placement Guarantee

### The Promise

**Consultant joins our bench → We place them within 30-60 days**

**What "Placement" Means:**
- ✅ W2 or 1099 contract role (we don't do full-time employment)
- ✅ Minimum 3-month contract (not 1-week gigs)
- ✅ Market rate or better ($80-$120/hr for Guidewire)
- ✅ Client is reputable (we don't send you to toxic environments)

**What Happens If We Don't Place in 60 Days:**
- We keep trying (no time limit, we want you placed)
- Provide career coaching (maybe your resume needs work? interview skills?)
- Offer training (upskill in BillingCenter if you only know PolicyCenter)
- Never charge you (our service is free for consultants)

### How We Achieve 30-Day Average

**Secret #1: Active Pipeline (Not Reactive)**

```
TRADITIONAL AGENCY:
├─ Consultant on bench: "We'll call you when we have something"
├─ Consultant waits: 45 days, no calls
├─ Consultant gets desperate: Reaches out, "Any updates?"
└─ Agency: "Still looking, hang tight"

INTIME:
├─ Day 1: Consultant joins bench, intake call (30 min)
├─ Day 2-7: Submitted to 10 active client JDs
├─ Day 8-14: 3 interview requests (schedule immediately)
├─ Day 15-21: 1 offer received (negotiate, accept)
└─ Day 22-30: Start new project (2 weeks notice at current, if applicable)
```

**Secret #2: Dedicated Bench Specialist (Not Generalist Recruiter)**

```
GENERALIST RECRUITER:
├─ Works on 50 things simultaneously
├─ 2 hours/week per bench consultant (not enough!)
└─ Result: Slow placements (45-60 days)

BENCH SPECIALIST (INTIME):
├─ Focuses ONLY on bench consultants
├─ 5-10 consultants max at any time
├─ 8 hours/week per consultant (proactive outreach)
└─ Result: Fast placements (30 days avg)
```

**Secret #3: Weekly Check-Ins (Accountability)**

```
EVERY MONDAY (9 AM call with consultant):

BENCH SPECIALIST: "Here's where we are:"
├─ "Submitted to 3 clients last week (ABC Insurance, XYZ Corp, DEF Consulting)"
├─ "ABC wants to interview you Thursday at 2 PM - can you make it?"
├─ "XYZ passed (they wanted BillingCenter, you're PolicyCenter-only)"
├─ "DEF hasn't responded yet (I'll follow up Wednesday)"

CONSULTANT: "Great! Yes, I can do Thursday 2 PM. Any prep needed?"

BENCH SPECIALIST: "Yes, review ABC's PolicyCenter setup (they use Cloud version).
                   I'll send you their case study. Practice explaining your rating
                   algorithm project. They love that stuff."

RESULT: Consultant feels supported, knows what's happening, stays positive
```

### Real-World Example: Vikram Patel

**Background:**
- 6 years ClaimCenter experience
- Previous agency: 45 days on bench, 2 submissions, 0 interviews
- Desperate: Bills piling up, savings depleting, family pressure

**InTime Timeline:**

```
DAY 1 (MONDAY): Vikram joins InTime bench
├─ Intake call (30 min): Understand skills, preferences, availability
├─ Resume review: AI optimizes for Guidewire keywords
└─ Bench specialist: "I'll submit you to 3 clients by Wednesday"

DAY 2 (TUESDAY): Vikram's resume submitted to:
├─ Client A: Healthcare insurer (ClaimCenter upgrade)
├─ Client B: Auto insurer (New ClaimCenter implementation)
└─ Client C: Property insurer (Maintenance and support)

DAY 3 (WEDNESDAY): Client A responds
├─ "Can Vikram interview today?" (urgent need)
├─ Bench specialist: Calls Vikram, sets up 2 PM interview
└─ Interview prep: "They'll ask about ClaimCenter 10.0, integration experience"

DAY 3 (2:00 PM): Vikram interviews with Client A
├─ Technical screening: Nails it (6 years experience shows)
├─ Project discussion: Exactly what Vikram has done before
├─ Culture fit: Great conversation
└─ Client: "When can you start?"

DAY 4 (THURSDAY): Offer received
├─ Rate: $85/hr
├─ Duration: 6 months (likely extended)
├─ Start date: Monday (5 days away)
└─ Vikram: "ACCEPTED!" (relief, gratitude)

DAY 8 (MONDAY): Vikram starts work
├─ Income restored: $85/hr × 40 hrs = $3,400/week
├─ Family stress gone: Can pay bills again
└─ Vikram to InTime: "You changed my life. Previous agency had me on
                       bench 45 days with no hope. You placed me in 12."
```

**InTime Revenue from Vikram:**
- Placement fee: $10,000 (one-time)
- Commission (Year 1): 5% × $85/hr × 2,080 hours = $8,840
- **Total Year 1:** $18,840

**Vikram's Lifetime Value:**
- Year 1: $18,840
- Year 2: $8,840 (commission, still with same client)
- Year 3: $8,840 + $10,000 (re-placed when project ends) = $18,840
- Plus referrals: 2 colleagues × $10,000 = $20,000
- **Total LTV:** $66,520

## Placement Workflow

### Step 1: Candidate Joins Bench (Day 0)

**Triggers:**
- Consultant fills website form: "I'm on bench, need placement"
- Referral: Colleague refers them
- Outbound: We find them on LinkedIn

**Bench specialist actions:**
- Review resume (5 min)
- Schedule intake call (30 min, within 24 hours)
- Add to bench pipeline in CRM

### Step 2: Intake & Optimization (Day 1-2)

- Intake call (covered above)
- Resume optimization (AI + manual review)
- Add to talent pool database (tagged: "bench," "immediate," "ClaimCenter")

### Step 3: Submissions (Day 2-7)

**Client outreach:**

```
EMAIL TO CLIENT:

SUBJECT: ClaimCenter consultant available immediately (6 years exp, $85/hr)

Hi [Client Name],

I have a ClaimCenter consultant available to start this week:

• 6 years ClaimCenter experience (healthcare insurance vertical)
• Reduced claim processing time 30% at previous client
• Available immediately (no 2-week notice)
• Rate: $85/hr (within your $80-$100 budget)
• Remote (can travel for kickoff if needed)

Resume attached. Interested in interviewing?

If not right now, I'll keep him in your pipeline for future needs.

Best,
[Bench Specialist Name]
```

**Response rate:**
- 30% (3 in 10 clients want to interview)
- If urgent client need: 80% (they're desperate)

### Step 4: Interviews (Day 8-14)

**Coordination:**
- Client wants to interview → Bench specialist coordinates schedule
- Prep consultant: "Here's what to expect, typical questions, client background"
- Post-interview: Collect feedback from both sides

**Interview outcomes:**
- 50%: Client likes consultant, makes offer
- 30%: Client passes (not a fit, found someone else, budget changed)
- 20%: Consultant passes (bad vibes, low rate, bad project)

### Step 5: Offer & Acceptance (Day 15-21)

**Negotiation (if needed):**
- Client offers $80/hr, consultant wants $90/hr → settle at $85/hr
- Client wants 12-month contract, consultant wants 6 months → compromise: 6 months + option to extend

**Contract types:**
- W2: InTime is employer, consultant is our employee, we bill client
- 1099: Consultant is independent contractor, we facilitate but don't employ
- Corp-to-corp: Consultant has own company (S-corp, LLC), invoices us, we invoice client

**InTime's preference:** W2 (more control, ongoing commission)

### Step 6: Start Date & Onboarding (Day 22-30)

**Week before start:**
- Confirm with consultant: "Still good for Monday? Any issues?"
- Confirm with client: "Laptop ready? Access provisioned? Point of contact assigned?"

**Day 1:**
- Consultant starts
- Bench specialist checks in: "How's your first day? Everything smooth?"

**Day 7, Day 30, Day 90:**
- Periodic check-ins (ensure both sides happy)
- If issues: Intervene, resolve, maintain relationship

## Consultant Journey

### Day 0: Crisis

**Situation:**
- Consultant's project ends (or gets laid off)
- Income stops immediately (no paycheck next Friday)
- Bills still due: Rent $2,000, car $400, groceries $600 = $3,000/month minimum
- Savings: Maybe 2-3 months runway

**Emotions:**
- Panic: "How will I pay rent?"
- Stress: Family relying on income
- Desperation: Applying to 50 jobs per day, getting no responses

**Previous Agency (Typical Experience):**
- Day 0: "We'll find you something, hang tight"
- Day 15: No calls, no updates
- Day 30: "Still looking, nothing yet"
- Day 45: Consultant emails: "Any update?" → "We're working on it"
- Day 60: Consultant gives up, finds job on own or joins another agency

### Day 1-7: Hope

**InTime Experience:**

**Day 1:**
- Consultant fills form: "I'm on bench, need placement urgently"
- Auto-response: "Thanks! We'll call you within 24 hours. We average 30-day placements."
- Bench specialist calls: 30-min intake (covered above)
- Consultant feels: "They actually care. They're proactive."

**Day 2-3:**
- Resume optimized, sent back for approval
- Consultant reviews: "Wow, this looks professional. I should've done this myself."
- Approves

**Day 4-7:**
- Submitted to 10 clients
- Email updates: "Submitted to ABC Insurance (ClaimCenter upgrade), XYZ Corp (new implementation), DEF Consulting (staff aug)"
- Consultant feels: "Finally, progress! Previous agency submitted me to 2 clients in 6 weeks."

### Day 8-14: Momentum

**Interviews:**
- Client A wants to interview (Tuesday 2 PM)
- Client B wants to interview (Thursday 10 AM)
- Client C passed (wanted BillingCenter, consultant is ClaimCenter-only)

**Prep calls:**
- Bench specialist: 30 min before each interview
- "Here's what to expect, typical questions, client background"
- "Focus on your workflow project at previous client. They love that."

**Interview #1 (Client A):**
- Goes well, technical questions answered correctly
- Client: "You're exactly what we need. Let me discuss with team, get back to you Friday."

**Interview #2 (Client B):**
- Also goes well
- Client: "We have 2 more candidates to interview. We'll decide by end of next week."

**Consultant feels:** "I have options! First time in 2 weeks I feel hopeful."

### Day 15-21: Offer

**Friday (Day 12):**
- Client A calls: "We'd like to make an offer. $85/hr, 6-month contract, start in 2 weeks. Interested?"
- Consultant: "Yes! But can we do $90/hr?"

**Monday (Day 15):**
- Client A: "We can do $87.50/hr. Final offer."
- Consultant: "Accepted!"
- Bench specialist: "Congrats! I'll send contract today. Sign by Wednesday, start in 2 weeks."

**Wednesday (Day 17):**
- Contract signed
- Start date: Monday, Week 4 (Day 22)

**Consultant feels:** "Relief. I can pay rent. Family stress gone. Life back on track."

### Day 22-30: New Beginning

**Monday (Day 22):**
- Consultant starts new project
- Income restored: $87.50/hr × 40 hrs × 4 weeks = $14,000/month (vs $0 last month)

**Day 30:**
- Bench specialist check-in: "How's it going? Client happy? You happy?"
- Consultant: "Great! Client is awesome, project is interesting, team is supportive."
- Bench specialist: "Perfect! We'll check in again at Day 90. If you need anything before then, call me anytime."

**Day 90:**
- Final check-in
- Consultant still happy, client still happy
- Bench specialist: "Glad it worked out! When this project ends, come back to us. We'll place you again."

**Future:**
- 6 months later: Project extends to 12 months (client loves consultant)
- 12 months later: Project ends
- Consultant calls InTime: "That was great. What's next?"
- InTime: "Welcome back! Let's find your next gig. Expect placement within 30 days."
- Consultant also refers 2 colleagues (both on bench elsewhere) to InTime
- InTime places both → earns $20,000 extra
