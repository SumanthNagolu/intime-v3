## Unit Economics

### Training Academy

**Per-Student Economics:**

```
REVENUE PER STUDENT:
├─ Subscription: $499/month × 2 months = $998
├─ Placement fee (80% placed): $5,000 × 0.80 = $4,000
└─ TOTAL: $4,998 lifetime value

COST PER STUDENT:
├─ AI mentor (GPT-4o-mini): 30 interactions × 500 tokens × $0.0006 = $18
├─ Platform costs (Supabase, Vercel): $30
├─ Support (trainer time): 2 hours × $100/hr = $200
└─ TOTAL: $248 cost to serve

GROSS PROFIT: $4,998 - $248 = $4,750
GROSS MARGIN: 95%

CONTRIBUTION TO RECRUITING:
- Every 100 students → 80 placements → $400,000 recruiting revenue
- Academy feeds recruiting pipeline (symbiotic relationship)
```

**Scalability:**

- **Marginal cost per additional student:** $50 (mostly AI)
- **At 1,000 students:** $4,998,000 revenue, $248,000 cost = 95% margin maintained
- **Bottleneck:** Trainer support time (2 hours/student × 1,000 = 2,000 hours/year = 1 FTE)
- **Solution:** Add 1 trainer per 500 students

### Recruiting Services

**Per-Placement Economics:**

```
REVENUE PER PLACEMENT:
└─ Flat fee: $5,000

COST PER PLACEMENT:
├─ Recruiter time (sourcing, screening, submitting): 8 hours × $75/hr = $600
├─ AI screening (GPT-4o-mini): 50 candidates × $0.005 = $0.25
├─ Marketing (LinkedIn ads, job boards): $400
└─ TOTAL: $1,000 cost per placement

GROSS PROFIT: $5,000 - $1,000 = $4,000
GROSS MARGIN: 80%

RECRUITER PRODUCTIVITY:
- 1 recruiter = 50 placements/year (1 per week)
- Revenue per recruiter: 50 × $5,000 = $250,000
- Cost per recruiter: $90,000 salary + $50,000 operating = $140,000
- Profit per recruiter: $110,000
```

**Scalability:**

- **Add 1 recruiter → Add $110,000 profit/year**
- **Year 1:** 6 pods (12 recruiters) = $1.32M profit
- **Year 3:** 20 pods (40 recruiters) = $4.40M profit
- **No diminishing returns** (more clients = more placements)

### Bench Sales

**Per-Consultant Economics:**

```
REVENUE PER CONSULTANT (Year 1):
├─ Placement fee: $10,000 (one-time)
├─ Commission: 5% of billing rate
│   • $85/hr × 40 hrs/week × 52 weeks = $176,800 annual billing
│   • 5% commission = $8,840/year
└─ TOTAL: $18,840 Year 1 revenue

COST PER CONSULTANT:
├─ Recruiter time (15 hours): $75/hr × 15 = $1,125
├─ Background check, vetting: $150
├─ Contract negotiation, paperwork: $225
└─ TOTAL: $1,500 cost per placement

GROSS PROFIT: $18,840 - $1,500 = $17,340
GROSS MARGIN: 92%

LIFETIME VALUE (3 years):
- Year 1: $18,840
- Year 2: $8,840 (commission only, still with same client)
- Year 3: $8,840 + $10,000 (re-placed) = $18,840
- TOTAL LTV: $46,520
```

**Scalability:**

- **60 consultants (Year 1):** $1,130,400 revenue, $90,000 cost = 92% margin
- **120 consultants (Year 2):** $2,260,800 revenue, $180,000 cost = 92% margin
- **Compounding:** Old consultants still pay commissions, new consultants add placement fees

## Profitability Analysis

### Year 1 Profit & Loss Statement

├─ Student AI costs (600 × $18)            $10,800
├─ Recruiting direct costs (300 × $1,000)  $300,000
├─ Bench direct costs (60 × $1,500)        $90,000
└─ TOTAL COGS:                             $400,800

GROSS PROFIT:                              $3,028,000

NET MARGIN:                                53.1%
```

**Why Such High Margins?**

1. **Low COGS:** Software-enabled business (AI does heavy lifting)
2. **Asset-Light:** No inventory, no manufacturing, no physical products
3. **Scalable:** Marginal cost per additional customer is minimal
4. **Recurring Revenue:** 24% of revenue is recurring (Academy + Bench commissions)
5. **High-Value Services:** $5K-$20K per transaction = premium pricing

### Profitability by Pillar

| Pillar | Revenue | COGS | Gross Profit | OPEX (allocated) | Net Profit | Net Margin |
|--------|---------|------|--------------|------------------|------------|------------|

---

## Funding Strategy

### Year 1-2: Bootstrapped Growth

**No outside funding needed because:**

1. Fast to cash-flow positive (Month 3)
2. High margins fund growth organically
3. Retain 100% equity (no dilution)

### Year 3: Optional Series A

**If we want to accelerate growth:**

```
RAISE: $5M at $50M pre-money valuation
DILUTION: 10% (founder retains 90%)
USE OF FUNDS:
├─ Hire 30 additional recruiters: $3M
├─ Marketing & brand building: $1M
├─ Technology & AI development: $500K
├─ Working capital & buffer: $500K
└─ TOTAL: $5M

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- Accelerate Year 3 revenue from $12.5M → $20M
- Increase Year 4 revenue from $25M → $50M
- Year 5 IPO-ready (exit at $1B+ valuation)

FOUNDER MATH:
- Pre-raise: 100% of $38M valuation = $38M net worth
- Post-raise: 90% of $1B valuation = $900M net worth
- Trade 10% today for 24× increase in value
```

**Alternative: Stay Bootstrapped**

```
SCENARIO: No fundraising ever

YEAR 5 OUTCOME:
- Revenue: $50M (same as funded scenario)
- Valuation: $150M (3× revenue)
- Founder ownership: 100%
- Net worth: $150M

TRADE-OFF:
- Slower growth (12-18 months delay to same revenue)
- Lower risk (no investor pressure, no dilution)
- More control (founder-led, not board-driven)

FOUNDER DECISION:
- If goal is $100M+ net worth → bootstrap (retain 100% of $150M)
- If goal is $1B+ exit → raise Series A (trade 10% for faster growth)
```
