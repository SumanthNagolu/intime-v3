## TA Overview

### Mission

> **"Build a $2M+ pipeline of enterprise clients who need 10+ Guidewire placements per year, establishing InTime as their exclusive Guidewire talent partner."**

### What is Talent Acquisition (TA) Pod?

**TA Pod** = Proactive business development (outbound sales) focused on landing enterprise clients

**Different from Recruiting Pod:**
- **Recruiting:** Reactive (client comes to us with job, we fill it)
- **TA:** Proactive (we identify companies implementing Guidewire, reach out first)

**Different from Bench Pod:**
- **Bench:** Placing consultants already on our bench
- **TA:** Building long-term client relationships (exclusive partnerships, retainers)

### Core Differentiators

1. **Market Intelligence:** We know who's implementing Guidewire before they even post jobs
2. **Proactive Outreach:** We reach out to CTO/VP Engineering, not wait for HR to post on LinkedIn
3. **Volume Hiring Support:** Help clients scale teams fast (10+ hires in 6 months)
4. **Strategic Partnerships:** Become embedded talent partner (monthly retainer + placement fees)
5. **Long-Term Focus:** Not one-off placements, but 3-5 year relationships

### Value Proposition

**For Clients:**
- **Speed:** We have pre-vetted talent ready (no 60-day recruiting cycle)
- **Quality:** Guidewire specialists, not generalists (we understand PolicyCenter vs ClaimCenter)
- **Volume:** Can deliver 10+ hires in months (traditional recruiting can't scale)
- **Partnership:** Dedicated account manager, monthly check-ins, proactive pipeline building

**For Business:**
- **Revenue:** $200K Year 1 (15 enterprise clients × $13K avg)
- **LTV:** $200K per client over 3 years (40 placements × $5K)
- **Margin:** 30% net margin Year 1 (improves to 50%+ Year 2 as retainers grow)
- **Cross-Pollination:** Enterprise clients have training budgets (refer employees to Academy)

## Outbound Strategy

### Multi-Channel Approach

**Channel 1: Email (Primary, 60% of outreach)**

**Cold Email Template:**

```
SUBJECT: PolicyCenter developers available (48-hour turnaround)

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is implementing Guidewire PolicyCenter
(saw the press release last week / job postings on LinkedIn).

Congratulations on the project!

Most companies struggle to find qualified PolicyCenter developers
(average 30-45 days to fill a role, which delays projects).

We're InTime - we specialize 100% in Guidewire talent and guarantee
candidate submission within 48 hours.

CURRENT AVAILABILITY (this month):
• 3× Senior PolicyCenter devs (5-8 years exp, $90-$110/hr)
• 5× Mid-level PolicyCenter devs (3-5 years exp, $75-$95/hr)
• 2× BillingCenter + PolicyCenter (rare combo, $100-$120/hr)

PRICING:
• Flat fee: $5,000 per placement (vs typical 15-25% = $15K-$25K)
• No retainer required (only pay when you hire)
• 30-day replacement guarantee

Would you like to see profiles? Happy to send 3 today if helpful.

Even if you're not hiring right now, good to have fast access when
urgent needs arise (we've saved several projects from missing deadlines).

Best,

P.S. We also train Guidewire developers (if you prefer to hire junior
     and upskill internally, we have 80+ grads ready to start).
```

- Open rate: 35% (35/week)

**Channel 2: LinkedIn (Secondary, 30% of outreach)**

**LinkedIn Message Template:**

```

PolicyCenter (congrats on the project!).

Quick question: How are you planning to staff the Guidewire team?

   - Present InTime value prop (48-hour guarantee, flat fee, pre-vetted talent)
   - Ask for first placement opportunity ("Can we submit candidates for your next role?")

2. **Follow-up:**
   - Send capabilities deck (case studies, client testimonials)
   - Introduce to recruiting pod (smooth handoff)
   - Set up monthly check-ins (even if not hiring yet)

3. **First placements:**
   - 10 clients express interest (50% of meetings)
   - 5 clients have immediate needs (place 1-2 consultants each)
   - 5 clients pipeline for future (3-6 months out)

**Revenue (Month 3):**
- 5 clients × 2 placements avg × $5K = **$50K placement fees**
- 3 clients sign retainer ($2,500/month) = **$7.5K MRR**

- Estimated 5-10 placements per 6 months ($20K-$40K placement fees)
- **Total revenue per client (6 months):** $35K-$55K

- Everything in Preferred tier, plus:
- Embedded recruiter (works on-site 1-2 days/week)
- Volume hiring support (help scale team 20+ people in 12 months)
- Training partnership (co-branded Academy program for their employees)
- Deeper discount ($3,500 per placement)

- **Total revenue per client (12 months):** $130K-$200K

**Tier 3: Exclusive Partner ($10,000/month retainer)**

- Everything in Strategic tier, plus:
- Exclusive partnership (we don't work with their direct competitors)
- Custom training programs (we train their employees on Guidewire)
- International recruiting (help them hire globally, not just US)
- White-glove service (24/7 support, dedicated Slack channel)

- Estimated 50-100 placements per 24 months ($175K-$350K placement fees)
- **Total revenue per client (24 months):** $415K-$590K

### Partnership Sales Process

**Step 1: Prove Value (First 3 Placements)**

```
TIMELINE: Month 1-3

GOAL: Deliver 3 successful placements (no retainer yet, just transactional)

ACTIVITIES:
├─ Place 1st consultant (Week 2): Show speed (48-hour guarantee)
├─ Place 2nd consultant (Week 6): Show quality (consultant performs well)
└─ Place 3rd consultant (Week 10): Show consistency (we're reliable)

CLIENT EXPERIENCE:
- "Wow, InTime is fast and good. We should use them more."
```

**Step 2: Propose Partnership (After 3 Placements)**

```
TIMELINE: Month 4

GOAL: Convert transactional client to Preferred Partner ($2,500/month retainer)

PITCH:
"You've hired 3 consultants from us (all performing well, right?).
Over next 6 months, you'll likely need 5-10 more Guidewire resources.

Instead of paying $5K each time, what if we did this:
- $2,500/month retainer (6 months = $15K upfront)
- Discounted placement fees: $4K each (vs $5K)
- Dedicated account manager (me, checking in monthly)
- Priority access to our best talent (Academy grads, top bench consultants)

IF you place 5 more consultants:
- Old way: 5 × $5K = $25K
- New way: $15K retainer + (5 × $4K) = $35K

Wait, that's MORE expensive?

YES, but you get:
- Faster placements (priority access = we call you first when great candidates appear)
- Better quality (we understand your culture, tech stack, preferences after 3 placements)
- Proactive pipeline (we build bench specifically for you, not reactive)

AND if you place 10 consultants (which you likely will):
- Old way: 10 × $5K = $50K
- New way: $15K retainer + (10 × $4K) = $55K

PLUS retainer is predictable (budget for it), placement fees are variable (based on actual hires).

Make sense?"
```

**Conversion Rate:**
- 23 clients onboarded (Year 1)
- 15 clients reach 3 placements (65%)
- 10 clients convert to Preferred Partner (67% of those eligible)
- 5 clients stay transactional (prefer pay-per-placement)

**Step 3: Upgrade to Strategic (After 12 Months)**

```
TIMELINE: Month 16 (after 12 months as Preferred Partner)

GOAL: Upgrade to Strategic Partner ($5,000/month retainer)

PITCH:
"We've worked together for a year. You've placed 12 consultants through us.
You're clearly scaling your Guidewire team (3 people → 15 people in 12 months).

Want to accelerate even more? Let's upgrade to Strategic Partnership:
- $5K/month retainer (vs $2.5K)
- Embedded recruiter (I'll work on-site 1-2 days/week, meet your team)
- Volume hiring support (help you hire 20 more in next 12 months)
- Deeper discount: $3.5K per placement (vs $4K)

IF you hire 20 consultants next year:
- Current plan: $30K retainer + (20 × $4K) = $110K
- Strategic plan: $60K retainer + (20 × $3.5K) = $130K

Difference: $20K more, but you get embedded recruiter (worth $100K if you hired full-time).

PLUS we'll co-brand training program: Your employees can take InTime Academy
courses for free (worth $500/person × 50 employees = $25K value).

Net: You save $105K on full-time recruiter + training, pay $20K more in fees.
     = $85K savings."
```

**Conversion Rate:**
- 10 Preferred Partners (after Year 1)
- 5 upgrade to Strategic (50% upgrade rate)
- 5 stay Preferred (happy with current tier)

```
TRANSACTIONAL MODEL (15 clients):
├─ Placements: 3 avg per client
├─ Revenue: 3 × $5,000 = $15,000

RETAINER MODEL (10 Preferred Partners):
