## The Core Principle

> **"Everything that happens in staffing happens in InTime"**
>
> Every email, every call, every meeting, every decision—all captured, all contextualized, all guided.

## The Three Pillars

1. **Unified Inbox** - Everything that needs attention, prioritized
2. **Context Engine** - Automatic understanding of what you're working on
3. **Communication Hub** - Email, phone, SMS, calendar all in one place

## Key Transformation

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| Screens | Flows (users follow workflows, not navigate screens) |
| Manual | Guided (system shows the next step) |
| Multiple tools | One app (email, phone, calendar in-app) |
| Reactive | Proactive (inbox surfaces what needs attention) |
| Data entry | Confirmation (system prepares, human approves) |
