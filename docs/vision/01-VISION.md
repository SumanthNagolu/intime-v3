# InTime: Vision Document

## The Problem

Staffing agencies run their business across a dozen disconnected tools:
- Candidates live in an ATS (Bullhorn, Ceipal)
- Clients tracked in a CRM or spreadsheets
- Timesheets in another system
- Payroll in another
- Emails for everything else

The result: **chaos**.

Recruiters spend 40% of their time on admin work instead of recruiting. Account managers don't know which clients are at risk until they churn. Operations coordinators drown in manual data entry. Managers can't see what's actually happening. Executives get reports that are already stale.

Every staffing agency has the same complaint: *"We don't have visibility."*

---

## The Vision

**InTime is a unified staffing operations platform that gives every person in a staffing agency exactly what they need to do their job—and nothing else.**

One platform. Seven connected workflows. Zero chaos.

## Core Workflows

### What a Recruiter's Day Looks Like

**Without InTime:**
1. Check email for new jobs
2. Search ATS for candidates (maybe)
3. Check spreadsheet for candidate status
4. Send submission via email
5. Log submission somewhere (if they remember)
6. Manually follow up in 2 days (if they remember)
7. Get feedback via email
8. Update spreadsheet
9. Repeat across 20 jobs

**With InTime:**
1. Open InTime → See inbox of "things that need attention"
2. New job at top → Click → See suggested candidates
3. Click "Submit" → Auto-generates submission
4. System schedules follow-up for 2 days
5. Feedback comes in → Notification appears
6. Click "Schedule Interview" → Candidate gets prepped automatically
7. Move to next item in inbox

**The difference:** Recruiters recruit. They don't manage spreadsheets.

### What an Account Manager's Day Looks Like

**Without InTime:**
1. Check calendar for scheduled calls
2. Prep by digging through emails and notes
3. No idea if account is healthy or at risk
4. Client complains about something they didn't know about
5. Scramble to fix
6. Renewals sneak up on them
7. Expansion opportunities missed

**With InTime:**
1. Open InTime → See account health scores
2. Red flag on "Acme Corp" → Click → See the issue
3. Click "Log Issue" → System tracks to resolution
4. See that renewal is in 60 days → Start conversation early
5. See that Acme has 3 departments not using us → Start expansion
6. Every interaction logged automatically from email/calendar

**The difference:** Account managers are proactive, not reactive.

### What Operations' Day Looks Like

**Without InTime:**
1. Email contractors to submit timesheets
2. Chase non-responders
3. Manually review each timesheet
4. Key into payroll system
5. Generate invoices manually
6. Chase approvals
7. Handle exceptions
8. Repeat weekly

**With InTime:**
1. Contractors submit timesheets in app (or mobile)
2. System flags exceptions automatically
3. Review exceptions only (not every timesheet)
4. One click: process payroll
5. One click: generate invoices
6. System tracks approvals
7. Dashboard shows what needs attention

**The difference:** Operations handles exceptions, not every transaction.

## What Makes InTime Different

### 1. Work Queue, Not Dashboards

Most software shows you dashboards: charts, numbers, trends. That's for executives looking backward.

InTime shows you a **work queue**: Here's what needs your attention, in priority order.

- *"3 submissions need follow-up today"*
- *"Interview feedback pending for Sarah Chen"*
- *"Timesheet exceptions: 2 need review"*
- *"Account health alert: Acme Corp"*

Click → Do → Next.

### 2. One Platform, Not Five Tools

Traditional setup:
- ATS for candidates
- CRM for clients
- Spreadsheets for tracking
- Email for communication
- Separate systems for timesheets, payroll, invoicing

InTime: One platform. Everything connected. Change a job status → Candidates see it. Submit a timesheet → Invoice auto-generates.

### 3. Context Everywhere

Click on a candidate → See their full history: every job they were submitted to, every interview, every note, every email.

Click on an account → See every contact, every job, every placement, account health score, revenue generated, issues logged.

No more hunting through email or asking colleagues "what happened with...?"

### 4. Modern UX (Not 2005 Enterprise Software)

- **Split view**: Click an item → Details appear on the side → Never lose context
- **Command palette**: Press ⌘K → Type what you want → "submit sarah to acme"
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Power users fly (G+J = Go to Jobs, C+C = Create Candidate)
- **Inline editing**: Click field → Type → Auto-saves
- **No modal hell**: Actions happen in context, not popups on popups

### 5. Automation That Works

Not "automation" that requires a PhD to configure.

- New job created → Suggested candidates appear automatically
- Submission made → Follow-up scheduled automatically
- Interview completed → Feedback request sent automatically
- Timesheet approved → Invoice line item created automatically
- Compliance expiring → Alert sent automatically

## Success Metrics

### For the Agency

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Time to fill | 40% faster | Faster placements = more revenue |
| Placements per recruiter | 30% more | Same team, more output |
| Client retention | 95%+ | Proactive account management |
| Billing accuracy | 99.99% | No revenue leakage |
| Admin time | 50% less | People do valuable work, not data entry |

### For Users

| Role | Success Looks Like |
|------|-------------------|
| Recruiter | "I know exactly what to work on next" |
| Account Manager | "I saw the problem before the client called" |
| Operations | "I only deal with exceptions, not every transaction" |
| Manager | "I can see how my team is performing in real time" |
| Executive | "I trust the forecast because I trust the data" |

## The Experience We're Building

### First 5 Minutes
User logs in → Sees their personalized work queue → Understands immediately what needs attention → Completes their first action in under 2 minutes.

### First Day
User handles their normal workload → Realizes they didn't open a spreadsheet once → Finishes work earlier than usual → Didn't forget anything.

### First Week
User discovers keyboard shortcuts → Moves even faster → Colleagues ask "what are you using?" → User can't imagine going back.

### First Month
Manager runs a report → Data is accurate → No one had to manually compile anything → Decisions made with confidence.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Show, don't tell** - Instead of training manuals, make it obvious what to do next
2. **Reduce, don't add** - Every feature must earn its place; complexity is the enemy
3. **Flow, don't interrupt** - Keep users in their workflow; avoid popups and page reloads
4. **Smart defaults** - The right choice should be the default choice
5. **Fail gracefully** - When something goes wrong, help the user recover

---

## The Ambition

**Year 1:** Replace Bullhorn/Ceipal for 100 agencies who want modern software

**Year 2:** Become the platform where staffing agencies standardize operations

**Year 3:** AI-native staffing: predictive matching, autonomous follow-ups, smart pricing

**The End State:** Running a staffing agency on InTime is like the difference between using a flip phone and an iPhone. Once you use it, you can't go back.

---

## Summary

InTime exists because staffing agencies deserve better software.

Not software that makes them more organized chaos. Software that eliminates chaos entirely.

One platform. Connected workflows. Work queues instead of dashboards. Modern UX instead of modal hell. Automation that actually works.

**The recruiter recruits. The account manager manages accounts. The operator handles exceptions. The manager manages. The executive leads.**

Everyone does their actual job. Nobody fights the software.

That's InTime.
