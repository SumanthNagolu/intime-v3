### Design Principles

**1. Pod Autonomy**
- Each pod operates as mini-business unit
- Senior + Junior pairing for mentorship
- Self-managing (CEO reviews metrics, not micro-tasks)
- Cross-functional (pods can cross-pollinate leads)

**2. Flat Hierarchy**
- Only 2 levels: CEO → Pod Leads (Seniors) → Juniors
- No "managers of managers" (kills speed)
- Decision-making pushed to frontline (Seniors empowered)

**3. Meritocracy**
- Promotions based on sprint performance (not tenure)
- Transparent metrics (everyone sees everyone's numbers)
- High performers rewarded aggressively (bonuses, equity, promotion)

**4. Cross-Pollination Incentives**
- Pods get attribution bonuses when leads convert in other pods
- Example: TA pod sources candidate → Recruiting places → TA gets 15% attribution
- Encourages collaboration, not siloing

---

## Pod System

### What is a Pod?

A **pod** is a **2-person autonomous team** (Senior + Junior) focused on a specific business function (recruiting, bench sales, talent acquisition).

**Why 2-Person Pods?**
1. **Mentorship:** Senior trains Junior in real-time
2. **Redundancy:** If one is sick/on vacation, pod still functions
3. **Efficiency:** 2 people can handle workload without bottlenecks
4. **Cost-Effective:** Smaller than 3-4 person teams, more leverage than solo
5. **Scalability:** Easy to add pods as business grows

### Pod Structure

### Pod Performance Metrics

Each pod is measured on **outcome metrics** (not activity):

| Pod Type | Primary Metric | Secondary Metrics |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Recruiting** | Placements per sprint (2 target) | Revenue, client satisfaction, time-to-fill |
| **Bench Sales** | Placements per month (5 target) | Days on bench (avg <30), consultant NPS |
| **Talent Acquisition** | Consultants added to network (5/week) | Attribution revenue, lead quality score |

**Dashboard:** Real-time pod performance visible to all (transparency = accountability)

## Compensation Models

### Philosophy

**1. Market-Competitive Base**
- Pay enough to attract top talent
- Not highest in market (can't afford), but competitive
- Mix of US-based (client-facing) and India-based (cost-optimized)

**2. Performance-Based Variable Comp**
- Commission: Tied to revenue (skin in the game)
- Bonuses: Tied to specific milestones (sprint targets, placement rates)
- Equity: Top performers get equity (Year 2+, once profitable)

**3. Transparency**
- Everyone knows how comp is calculated (no hidden formulas)
- Dashboards show real-time earnings (commission tracking visible)
- Peer visibility (top earners celebrated, motivates others)

### Base Salary by Role (US vs India)

| Role | US Base | India Base | Notes |
|------|---------|------------|-------|
| **CEO** | $0 (Year 1) | N/A | Takes profit distribution, not salary |
| **Senior Recruiter** | $60,000 | INR 50,000/mo ($7,200/year) | US for client-facing |
| **Junior Recruiter** | $36,000 | INR 15,000/mo ($2,160/year) | Can be remote India |
| **Senior Bench Specialist** | $60,000 | INR 50,000/mo ($7,200/year) | High-touch, US preferred |
| **Junior Bench Specialist** | $36,000 | INR 15,000/mo ($2,160/year) | Can be India |
| **Senior TA** | $60,000 | INR 50,000/mo ($7,200/year) | US for strategic roles |
| **Junior TA** | $36,000 | INR 15,000/mo ($2,160/year) | India (cold calling) |
| **Training Trainer** | $70,000 | INR 60,000/mo ($8,640/year) | Technical expertise required |
| **Cross-Border Coordinator** | N/A | INR 25,000/mo ($3,600/year) | India-based, part-time |
| **Operations Manager** | $55,000 | INR 45,000/mo ($6,480/year) | Can be India |
| **Customer Support** | $40,000 | INR 20,000/mo ($2,880/year) | India preferred (cost) |

**Rationale for India-Based Roles:**
- **Cost Optimization:** INR salaries 80-90% cheaper than US
- **Talent Pool:** India has deep Guidewire talent (many Guidewire projects)
- **Time Zone:** India works US hours (9 AM - 5 PM IST = 11:30 PM - 7:30 AM EST, next day)
  - Hybrid model: Some work during India day, some during US overlap
- **Founder Location:** CEO based in India (easier to manage local team)

**Year 1 Headcount Mix:**
- **US-based:** 6 people (client-facing roles)
- **India-based:** 12 people (back-office, support, junior roles)
- **Total:** 18 people

**Total Base Salary Cost (Year 1):**
- US team: 6 × $50,000 avg = $300,000
- India team: 12 × $3,840 avg = $46,080
- **Total:** $346,080

### Commission Structure

**Recruiting Pod:**
- **Senior:** 2% of placement fee or ongoing billing
  - Example: $350K pod revenue × 2% = $17,500/year
- **Junior:** 3% of placement revenue
  - Example: $350K pod revenue × 3% = $7,000/year

**Bench Sales Pod:**
- **Senior:** 3% of placement fee or ongoing billing
  - Placement: $600K × 5% = $30,000/year
  - Ongoing (if applicable): 10 consultants × $13,856/month × 2% × 12 = $33,254/year
  - **Total:** $63,254/year (high earners!)
- **Junior:** 3% of placement fee or ongoing billing
  - Placement: $600K × 2% = $12,000/year
  - Ongoing: 10 consultants × $13,856/month × 1% × 12 = $16,627/year
  - **Total:** $28,627/year

**Talent Acquisition Pod:**
- **Senior:** 15% attribution bonus + $500 per referral placement
  - Attribution: $150K × 15% = $22,500/year
  - Referrals: 20 × $500 = $10,000/year
  - **Total:** $32,500/year
- **Junior:** 5% attribution bonus
  - Attribution: $150K × 5% = $7,500/year

**Training Academy:**

- Transparent (everyone knows formula)
- Motivating (see commissions grow in real-time dashboard)

  - Senior: $1,000 × 12 months = $12,000/year
  - Junior: $500 × 12 months = $6,000/year

**Talent Acquisition Pod:**
- **Target:** 5 new consultants added to network per week
- **Bonus:** $200 per person if target hit
  - Senior: $200 × 52 weeks = $10,400/year
  - Junior: $100 × 52 weeks = $5,200/year

**Why Sprint Bonuses Matter:**
- Creates urgency (can't coast for 11 months then hustle in December)
- Psychological wins (celebrate small victories)
- Course-correction (if miss sprint, adjust next sprint)

---

### Equity (Year 2+)

**Philosophy:** Top performers become owners (align long-term)

**Year 1:** No equity (focus on cash compensation, prove model)
**Year 2:** Introduce equity pool (5-10% of company)

**Eligibility:**
- Must be Senior-level (or exceptional Junior promoted to Senior)
- 12+ months tenure
- Top 20% performer (based on metrics)
- CEO discretion (culture fit, leadership potential)

**Vesting:**
- 4-year vesting (1-year cliff, then monthly)
- Example: 1% equity grant = 0.25% after 1 year, then 0.0625% per quarter

**Why Delay Until Year 2:**
- Year 1 = prove model, high churn risk (don't dilute prematurely)
- Year 2 = profitable, sustainable, ready to lock in A-players long-term

- Base: $60,000
- Attribution bonus: $32,500
- Referral bonus: $10,000
- **Total:** $102,500/year (1.7x base)

**Key Insight:** Variable comp = 50-70% of total comp for high performers (huge upside!)

## Culture & Values

### Core Values

**1. Best, Only the Best, Nothing But the Best**
- **Meaning:** Quality over quantity (always)
- **Behaviors:**
  - Don't submit unqualified candidates (hurts client trust)
  - Don't cut corners on training (students graduate job-ready)
  - Don't compromise on hires (A-players only, no B/C-players)
- **Example:** Recruiting pod has 5 candidates, but only 2 are truly qualified → Submit 2, not 5

**2. Learn, Update, Iterate, Process as We Go**
- **Meaning:** No sacred cows, everything is improvable
- **Behaviors:**
  - Weekly retros (what worked, what didn't, what to change)
  - Experiment bias (try new approaches, measure results)
  - Fail fast (if something doesn't work, kill it quickly)
  - Document learnings (so we don't repeat mistakes)
- **Example:** TA pod tries new LinkedIn outreach template, tracks response rate, keeps if >10%, kills if <5%

**3. All Equal Importance**
- **Meaning:** No job is "beneath" anyone, hierarchy is minimal
- **Behaviors:**
  - CEO answers support tickets if volume spikes (everyone chips in)
  - Senior Recruiter helps Junior with data entry if swamped (team over ego)
  - No "that's not my job" attitude (we do what needs doing)
- **Example:** Student has urgent issue on Friday 5 PM, trainer stays late to help (even though "day is over")

**4. Student Success = Job Placement**
- **Meaning:** Certificate means nothing, job means everything
- **Behaviors:**
  - Track placement rate religiously (80%+ target)
  - Recruiting pod prioritizes academy grads (help them succeed)
  - Don't graduate students who aren't job-ready (better to delay than send unprepared)
- **Example:** Student wants to graduate early (after 6 weeks), trainer says "You're close, but need 2 more weeks to be truly job-ready. Let's finish strong."

**5. Cross-Pollination = Compound Revenue**
- **Meaning:** One conversation can yield 5+ revenue opportunities
- **Behaviors:**
  - Always ask cross-pollination questions in every call
  - CRM captures all opportunities (not just primary reason for call)
  - Celebrate cross-sells (TA pod gets attribution bonus when recruiting places their lead)
- **Example:** Recruiting call with candidate reveals they need training → create Academy lead → candidate enrolls → $998 revenue (would've missed without cross-pollination)

**6. Speed Wins**
- **Meaning:** 48-hour turnaround is our competitive moat
- **Behaviors:**
  - Respond to client JDs same day (not "we'll get back to you next week")
  - Candidates submitted within 24-48 hours of qualification
  - No bureaucracy (approvals happen fast, not 5-layer sign-off)
- **Example:** Client sends JD Friday 3 PM → Recruiter finds 3 candidates by Saturday noon → Client interviews Monday → Offer Tuesday → Candidate starts next Monday (7-day total cycle!)

---

## Performance Management

### Sprint Reviews (Every 2 Weeks)

**For Recruiting & Bench Pods:**
- **Metric:** Placements (target: 2 per sprint for recruiting, 2.5 for bench)
- **Review Process:**
  - Manager (CEO or Senior) reviews dashboard
  - If target hit: Celebrate (bonus paid automatically)
  - If target missed: 15-min conversation
    - What went wrong? (pipeline issue, deal fell through, etc.)
    - What to adjust next sprint? (more prospecting, better qualification)
    - Support needed? (tools, training, help)

**For TA Pod:**
- **Metric:** Consultants added to network (target: 5/week = 10 per sprint)
- **Review:** Same process as above

**No Punishment for Missing One Sprint:**
- Occasional misses are normal (deals fall through, timing issues)
- Concern if missing 3+ sprints in a row (then deeper conversation needed)

---

### Monthly 1-on-1s (Manager + Direct Report)

**Format (30-45 minutes):**
1. **Performance Review (15 min):**
   - Dashboard review (placements, revenue, metrics)
   - Celebrate wins (specific call-outs)
   - Address gaps (what's not working?)

2. **Career Development (15 min):**
   - Learning goals (what skills to develop?)
   - Promotion readiness (timeline to Senior?)
   - Challenges/frustrations (what's blocking growth?)

3. **Feedback Both Ways (15 min):**
   - Manager gives feedback (constructive, specific)
   - Employee gives feedback (what manager can improve?)
   - Action items (what to change next month?)

**Purpose:** Coaching (not punishment), growth (not stagnation)

---

### Quarterly Performance Reviews (Formal)

**Format (60 minutes, CEO or Senior Manager):**

1. **Quantitative Review (30 min):**
   - Metrics dashboard (placements, revenue, targets)
   - Comparison to peers (percentile ranking)
   - Trend analysis (improving or declining?)

2. **Qualitative Review (20 min):**
   - Culture fit (living values?)
   - Team collaboration (cross-pollination?)
   - Growth mindset (learning from mistakes?)

3. **Compensation Adjustment (10 min):**
   - If top 20%: Raise (5-10% base increase) or equity discussion (Year 2+)
   - If top 50%: On track (no change, but positive reinforcement)
   - If bottom 20%: Performance improvement plan (30-60 days to improve or exit)

**Outcome:**
- **Promotions:** Junior → Senior (if ready, typically 12-18 months)
- **Raises:** Top performers get annual raises (5-10%)
- **Exits:** Bottom 10% (not improving) gracefully exited (2-week severance)

---

### Performance Improvement Plans (PIPs)

**Trigger:** 3 consecutive missed sprint targets OR cultural misfit

**Process (60 days):**
1. **Week 1:** Formal PIP document (specific gaps, measurable targets)
   - Example: "Missed sprint targets 3 times. Next 60 days: hit 80% of target minimum."
2. **Week 2-8:** Weekly check-ins (manager + employee)
   - Track progress, provide support (training, tools, coaching)
3. **Week 9 (End of 60 days):** Final review
   - If improved: Celebrate, continue (off PIP)
   - If not improved: Graceful exit (2-week severance, reference letter)

**Purpose:** Give people a chance to improve, but act decisively if no change

---

## Office Setup

### Year 1: In-Office (Hyderabad or Bangalore)

**Why In-Office Initially:**
1. **Culture Building:** "Learn, update, iterate" requires rapid collaboration
2. **Mentorship:** Seniors train Juniors in real-time (shadowing, coaching)
3. **Speed:** Decisions made in minutes, not async Slack threads
4. **Accountability:** Visual presence, peer pressure (positive), team energy
5. **Founder-Led:** CEO needs to imprint values (impossible remote initially)

**Office Layout (1,500 sq ft):**

---

### Daily Office Routine

**9:00 AM: Everyone Arrives**
- Daily standup (15 min, all hands)
- Coffee, casual chat (bonding)

**9:15 AM - 12:00 PM: Deep Work**
- Calls (client, candidate, consultant)
- Sourcing (LinkedIn, databases)
- CRM updates
- Minimal interruptions (focus time)

**12:00 PM - 1:00 PM: Lunch**
- **Team eats together daily** (critical for culture!)
- Not talking about work (bonding time)
- Sometimes CEO buys lunch (celebrate wins)

**1:00 PM - 5:00 PM: Deep Work Continues**
- Afternoon block (same as morning)
- Cross-pollination conversations (pods share leads)

**5:00 PM: Debrief**
- 15-min recap (what worked today, what didn't)
- Celebrate wins (placements, client meetings)
- Plan tomorrow

**5:15 PM: Go Home**
- No crazy hours (respect work-life balance)
- Sustainable pace (marathon, not sprint)

---

## Remote Work Policy

### Year 1: In-Office Only (Exceptions Rare)

**Rationale:**
- Culture is fragile early (need to establish norms)
- Mentorship requires in-person (Juniors learn by observing)
- Speed requires real-time (can't wait for Slack responses)
- Accountability easier (visual presence)

**Exceptions:**
- Sick (work from home if feeling unwell)
- Family emergency (take time off, we understand)
- Special circumstances (case-by-case, CEO approves)

---

### Month 6+: Hybrid Eligible (Proven Performers)

**Criteria:**
- ☑ 6+ months tenure (proven)
- ☑ Consistently hit targets (last 6 sprints)
- ☑ Self-disciplined (manager's discretion)
- ☑ Role allows (some roles require office, e.g., trainers for live sessions)

**Hybrid Schedule:**
- **Mon-Wed:** In-office (collaboration days)
  - Standups, client calls, team sync
- **Thu-Fri:** Remote (focus days)
  - Sourcing, screening, CRM work

**Why This Works:**
- 3 days in-person = maintain culture
- 2 days remote = flexibility, work-life balance
- Best of both worlds

---

### Year 2+: Full Remote (Top Performers Only)

**Criteria:**
- ☑ 12+ months tenure
- ☑ Senior-level (or exceptional Junior promoted)
- ☑ Top 20% performer
- ☑ CEO approval

**Full Remote Policy:**
- Work from anywhere (home, coffee shop, India, US, anywhere)
- **But:** Attend monthly in-office day (all-hands, team bonding)
- Tools required:
  - Daily video standups (camera on)
  - Voice logs 3x/day (morning plan, midday update, evening summary)
  - Metrics dashboard (transparent, real-time)

**Why Allow Full Remote:**
- Retain top talent (some want full remote)
- Geographic expansion (hire anywhere, not just Hyderabad)
- Cost savings (less office space needed)

---

### How We Maintain Culture & Accountability (Remote)

**1. Daily Video Standups**
- Camera required (see faces, build connection)
- 15 min max (respect time)
- Same format as in-office

**2. Voice Logs (3x/day)**
- Morning (9 AM): What's my plan today?
- Midday (12 PM): Progress check
- Evening (5 PM): What did I accomplish?
- Purpose: Async accountability (CEO can review anytime)

**3. Metrics Dashboard (Transparent)**
- Everyone sees everyone's performance (no hiding)
- Real-time updates (placements, revenue, calls made)
- Peer pressure (positive, motivates)

**4. Weekly 1-on-1s**
- Manager checks in (30 min video call)
- Not micromanage, but support (blockers, questions)

**5. Monthly In-Office Day**
- All remote employees come to office (1 day/month)
- Strategic planning (2-3 hours)
- Team bonding (lunch, social time)
- Reconnect with culture

**6. Slack Culture**
- Active, responsive (not isolated)
- Public channels (transparency)
- Virtual water cooler (#random for non-work chat)

---

## Team Rituals

### Daily Standup (9:00 AM, 15 minutes)

**Format:**
```
Each person (2 min max):
├─ Yesterday's wins (1 placement! Client meeting went great!)
├─ Today's priorities (10 screening calls, submit 3 candidates)
└─ Blockers (CRM is slow, need help)

CEO highlights (1-2 min):
├─ Company news (we hit $50K revenue this week!)
└─ Shout-outs (Sarah crushed it with 3 placements this sprint!)
```

**Rules:**
- Camera on (even if remote)
- No laptops open (be present)
- Celebrate wins (clapping, high-fives)
- Keep it short (15 min max, no exceptions)

---

### Weekly Retro (Friday 4 PM, 30 minutes)

**Format:**
```
What worked this week? (Keep doing)
├─ New LinkedIn template got 15% response rate (keep!)
├─ Early morning calls with West Coast clients worked well
└─ AI resume generator saved 3 hours/candidate

What didn't work? (Stop doing)
├─ Cold calling after 5 PM (no one answers)
├─ Too many meetings (killed focus time)
└─ Slack interruptions during deep work

What to try next week? (Experiments)
├─ Experiment: Cold email to Guidewire partners
├─ Experiment: Video outreach on LinkedIn
└─ Experiment: Referral contest ($500 bonus for most referrals)

Process improvements?
├─ CRM is slow → Ops Manager to investigate
├─ Calendar sync broken → Customer Support to fix
└─ Need better call scripts → Seniors to create templates
```

**Purpose:** Continuous improvement (embodies "learn, update, iterate")

---

### Monthly Town Hall (Last Friday, 60 minutes)

**Format:**
```
CEO Presents (30 min):
├─ Revenue update (Month 6: $245K revenue, $185K profit!)
├─ Key wins (15 placements this month, 3 new clients)
├─ Strategic priorities (Next month: launch B2B SaaS beta)
├─ Team shout-outs (Top performers: Sarah, Raj, Maria!)
└─ Transparent financials (show P&L, runway, metrics)

├─ Anyone can ask CEO anything (no off-limits)
├─ Examples:

## Career Progression

### Junior → Senior Track (12-18 months)

**Progression Criteria:**
- ☑ Consistently hit targets (80%+ of sprints)
- ☑ Demonstrate senior-level skills:
  - Recruiting: Can close clients (not just source)
  - Bench: Can negotiate rates (not just submit)
  - TA: Can conduct strategic conversations (not just screen)
- ☑ Mentorship ability (can train new Junior)
- ☑ Cultural leadership (embodies values)

**Promotion Process:**
1. **Self-Assessment (Quarter 3-4):**
   - Junior fills out "Promotion Readiness" form
   - Lists accomplishments, growth areas
2. **Manager Review (Week after self-assessment):**
   - Manager evaluates readiness
   - Provides feedback (ready, not yet, or gap areas)
3. **CEO Review (If manager recommends):**
   - CEO interviews Junior (30 min)
   - Tests senior-level thinking (role-plays, case studies)
4. **Decision (Within 2 weeks):**
   - If promoted: New title, new comp (Senior base + commission)
   - If not yet: Clear roadmap (what to improve, timeline 3-6 months)

**Typical Timeline:**
- **Fast Track:** 12 months (exceptional Junior)
- **Normal:** 15-18 months (solid Junior)
- **Slow Track:** 24 months (needs more development)

---

### Senior → Pod Lead/Manager Track (Year 2+)

**Role:** Manage 2-3 pods (6-9 people) in same function (e.g., Recruiting Lead)

**Criteria:**
- ☑ 12+ months as Senior
- ☑ Top 20% performer
- ☑ Leadership demonstrated (mentored 2+ Juniors to Senior)
- ☑ Strategic thinker (sees beyond individual deals)

**Compensation:**
- Base: $80,000 (US) OR INR 70,000/month ($10,080/year, India)
- Commission: 2% of team's revenue (not just personal)
  - Example: 3 pods × $350K = $1.05M × 2% = $21,000/year
- **Total:** $101,000/year (US) or $31,080/year (India)

---

### Individual Contributor (IC) Track (Year 2+)

**For those who don't want to manage:**

**Senior IC → Staff IC → Principal IC**
- **Senior IC:** Standard Senior (18 months+ experience)
- **Staff IC:** Top 10% performer, 3+ years, expert-level (trains others)
  - Comp: $90,000 base + higher commission (7%)
- **Principal IC:** Top 1%, 5+ years, thought leader (speaks at conferences)
  - Comp: $120,000 base + highest commission (10%)

## Conclusion

InTime's organizational structure is **designed for speed, quality, and cross-pollination**. The 2-person pod system creates autonomy while maintaining mentorship. The mixed US/India model optimizes costs without sacrificing client-facing quality. The culture rituals embed "learn, update, iterate" into daily operations.

**This is not traditional corporate structure. This is a living organism that evolves, learns, and scales.**

Year 1 proves the model. Year 2 scales it. Year 5 IPOs it.

**Let's build the best staffing company the Guidewire industry has ever seen.** 🚀
