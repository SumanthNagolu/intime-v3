### Pillar 3: Bench Sales

**What It Is:**
- **30-60 day placement guarantee** for consultants on bench

**Key Metrics:**
- Pipeline value: $2M+ (potential placements in next 6 months)
- Client acquisition cost: <$5,000 (paid back with 1 placement)
- Client lifetime value: $200K+ (40 placements over 3 years)
- Win rate: 30%+ (3 in 10 prospects become paying clients)

**Success Story:**
> **TechCorp Insurance** - Implementing Guidewire CloudCenter → needs 15 developers in 6 months → traditional recruiting can't keep up → InTime TA pod builds dedicated pipeline → delivers 2-3 qualified candidates per week → TechCorp hires 12 of 18 submitted (67% hire rate) → $60K in placement fees + $30K retainer = $90K revenue.

- Goal Year 1: 5 placements × $20K = $100,000 revenue (pilot year)
- Goal Year 3: 50 placements × $20K = $1,000,000 revenue (scaled)

## Pod Structure

### 2-Person Teams for Maximum Efficiency

Every pillar is run by a **2-person pod (Senior + Junior)**:

```
POD STRUCTURE:

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│          POD (2 People)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                     │
│  👤 SENIOR (80% productivity)       │
│  ├─ 5+ years experience            │
│  ├─ Strategic decisions            │
│  ├─ Client relationships           │
│  ├─ Mentors junior                 │
│  └─ Salary: $90K-$120K             │
│                                     │
│  👤 JUNIOR (40% productivity)       │
│  ├─ 0-2 years experience           │
│  ├─ Tactical execution             │
│  ├─ Research, admin, scheduling    │
│  ├─ Learning from senior           │
│  └─ Salary: $50K-$70K              │
│                                     │
│  TOTAL POD CAPACITY: 1.2× senior   │
│  TOTAL POD COST: $140K-$190K       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why 2-Person Pods?**

1. **Knowledge Transfer:**
   - Senior teaches junior (grows future seniors)
   - Junior becomes senior in 2-3 years
   - Reduces hiring needs (promote from within)

2. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - 1 senior alone = 1.0× output, $120K cost
   - 1 senior + 1 junior = 1.2× output, $170K cost
   - Slight cost increase for 20% more output + training junior

3. **Redundancy:**
   - If senior is sick/on vacation, junior can cover basics
   - No single point of failure

4. **Scalability:**
   - Junior in Pod A becomes senior in new Pod B
   - Promotion path clear (junior → senior → pod lead)

**Pod Performance Targets:**

| Pod Type | Target | Metric | Year 1 Goal |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Training Academy** | 10 students/month per pod | Course completions | 120 students/pod/year |
| **Recruiting** | 2 placements/sprint (every 2 weeks) | Placements per pod | 50 placements/pod/year |
| **Bench Sales** | 1 placement/month per pod | Bench placements | 12 placements/pod/year |
| **Talent Acquisition** | 3 enterprise clients/quarter | Active clients | 12 clients/pod/year |
| **Cross-Border** | 1 immigration case/2 months | Completed cases | 6 cases/pod/year |

**Year 1 Pod Configuration:**

| Pillar | # of Pods | Headcount | Annual Cost | Revenue Target |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Training Academy | 1 pod | 2 people | $170,000 | $598,800 |
| Recruiting | 6 pods | 12 people | $1,020,000 | $1,500,000 |
| Bench Sales | 1 pod | 2 people | $170,000 | $1,130,000 |
| Talent Acquisition | 1 pod | 2 people | $170,000 | $200,000 |
| Cross-Border | 0.5 pod* | 1 person | $60,000 | $0 (pilot) |
| **TOTAL** | **9.5 pods** | **19 people** | **$1,590,000** | **$3,428,800** |

*Cross-border starts with 1 part-time specialist, scales to full pod in Year 2

## Revenue Streams

### Year 1 Breakdown ($3.43M Total)

| Pillar | Revenue Streams | Year 1 Target | % of Total |
|--------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| **Training Academy** | Student subscriptions | $598,800 | 17% |
| **Recruiting** | Placement fees | $1,500,000 | 44% |
| **Bench Sales** | Placement fees + commissions | $1,130,000 | 33% |
| **Talent Acquisition** | Retainers + placement fees | $200,000 | 6% |
| **Cross-Border** | Pilot (no revenue Year 1) | $0 | 0% |
| **TOTAL** | | **$3,428,800** | **100%** |

### Revenue Model Advantages

**1. Recurring Revenue (Academy + Bench Commissions)**
```
SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE (Academy):
- 50 active students/month × $499 = $24,950/month
- Annual recurring: $299,400

COMMISSION REVENUE (Bench):
- 60 active consultants × $8,840/year = $530,400
- Grows as more consultants placed (Year 2: 120 consultants = $1M+)

TOTAL RECURRING: $829,800 (24% of Year 1 revenue)
```

**2. High-Margin Services (Training)**
```
ACADEMY UNIT ECONOMICS:
- Revenue per student: $998
- Cost per student: $250 (AI mentor $18 + platform $30 + support $200)
- Gross margin: $748 (75% margin!)

SCALABILITY:
- Marginal cost per additional student: ~$50 (mostly AI costs)
- At 1,000 students: $998K revenue, $250K cost = 75% margin maintained
```

**3. Transaction-Based (Recruiting)**
```
RECRUITING UNIT ECONOMICS:
- Revenue per placement: $5,000
- Cost per placement: $1,200 (recruiter time $800 + marketing $400)
- Gross margin: $3,800 (76% margin!)

SCALABILITY:
- More clients = more placements per recruiter (efficiency gains)
- Year 1: 50 placements/recruiter
- Year 3: 100 placements/recruiter (same headcount, 2× revenue)
```

**4. Diversified Risk**
```
NO SINGLE PILLAR > 44% of revenue:
- If recruiting has bad quarter → academy + bench still performing
- If academy enrollment slows → recruiting + TA compensate
- Diversification = stability
```

## Unit Economics

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) vs Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Training Academy:**
```
STUDENT LTV:
- Direct revenue: $998 (tuition)
- Placement fee: $5,000 × 80% placement rate = $4,000
- Referrals: 2 friends × $1,000 × 50% conversion = $1,000
- TOTAL LTV: $5,998

STUDENT CAC:
- SEO: $0 (organic)
- Content marketing: $200/student
- Referral bonus: $1,000 (if referred)
- AVERAGE CAC: $300

LTV/CAC RATIO: $5,998 / $300 = 20× (excellent!)
```

**Recruiting Services:**
```
CLIENT LTV (3 years):
- Year 1: 3 placements × $5,000 = $15,000
- Year 2: 5 placements × $5,000 = $25,000
- Year 3: 8 placements × $5,000 = $40,000
- TOTAL LTV: $80,000

CLIENT CAC:
- Inbound (SEO): $0
- Outbound (TA pod time): $2,000 (40 hours × $50/hr)
- AVERAGE CAC: $1,000

LTV/CAC RATIO: $80,000 / $1,000 = 80× (incredible!)
```

**Bench Sales:**
```
CONSULTANT LTV:
- Placement fee: $10,000
- Commission (Year 1): $8,840
- Repeat placements (Year 2-3): $20,000
- Referrals: 2 colleagues × $10,000 = $20,000
- TOTAL LTV: $58,840

CONSULTANT CAC:
- Inbound (SEO): $0
- Recruiter time: $500 (10 hours)
- AVERAGE CAC: $250

LTV/CAC RATIO: $58,840 / $250 = 235× (exceptional!)
```

## Competitive Advantages

### Why InTime Wins

| Advantage | Traditional Agencies | InTime |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| **Speed** | 30 days average | 48 hours |
| **Specialization** | Generalist (5% Guidewire) | 100% Guidewire |
| **Talent Creation** | None (just place existing) | Train 600 students/year |
| **Bench** | 20-50 consultants | Unlimited (train our own) |
| **Cross-Pollination** | Separate businesses | 1 customer = 5 revenue streams |
| **Technology** | Manual (spreadsheets) | AI-powered automation |
| **Pricing** | 15-25% of salary ($15K-$25K) | $5K flat fee |
| **Guarantees** | None | 48-hour submission, 30-day replacement |
| **Data** | Vendor lock-in | Own 100% of data |

**Moat That's Hard to Replicate:**

1. **Training Academy** → Requires curriculum, AI mentor, placement network (6+ months to build)
2. **Guidewire Specialization** → 10+ years founder expertise (can't be copied)
3. **Cross-Pollination Platform** → Requires integrated tech stack (competitors have bolt-on tools)
4. **Speed** → Impossible without pre-trained talent pool + AI automation
5. **Living Organism** → Platform learns and improves daily (competitors' processes are fixed)
