## Critical Path & Dependencies

### Critical Path (Must-Have for Success)

**Dependency Chain:**

```
1. CEO → Senior Recruiter #1 → First Client → First Placement
   └─ If no client by Week 3: HALT (business model unproven)

2. First Client → First Placement (Week 6-8)
   └─ If no placement by Month 2: DIAGNOSE (are candidates qualified?)

3. First Placement → Break-Even (Month 3)
   └─ If no break-even by Month 4: PIVOT (costs too high or revenue too low)

4. Break-Even → Scale Pods (Month 4-6)
   └─ Only scale if Month 3 break-even proven

5. Scale Pods → Optimization (Month 7-9)
   └─ Only optimize if pods hitting targets

6. Optimization → Year 2 Prep (Month 10-12)
   └─ Only prepare for Year 2 if Year 1 on track
```

**Bench Pod Dependencies:**
- ☑ Consultant database (track bench consultants)

  - Competitive comp (top 50th percentile in market)
