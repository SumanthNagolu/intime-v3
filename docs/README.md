# InTime Documentation

## Overview

InTime is a unified staffing operations platform transforming from a Guidewire-inspired web app into a **desktop-first workspace** where the entire organization works.

> **"Everything that happens in staffing happens in InTime"**
>
> Every email, every call, every meeting, every decision—all captured, all contextualized, all guided.

## Key Principles

1. **One App** - Email, phone, calendar, everything in InTime
2. **Work Queue** - Inbox shows what needs attention, not dashboards
3. **Context Everywhere** - System knows what you're working on
4. **Guided Workflows** - Shows the next step, not just options
5. **Automate the Mundane** - Humans do judgment, system does data entry
