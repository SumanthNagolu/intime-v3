## Company Overview

### About InTime

InTime is a US-based IT staffing and consulting company with a deep operational hub in Hyderabad, India. We specialize in placing high-caliber IT professionals—particularly Guidewire specialists and other niche technology experts—with leading organizations across the United States.

Founded in 2025, InTime combines the speed and cost-efficiency of global talent sourcing with the quality and accountability of a premium staffing firm. Unlike traditional "body shops," we build and train our own talent, ensuring every consultant meets rigorous standards before placement.

**Headquarters:** [US Location]
**Operations Hub:** Hyderabad, India
**Founded:** 2025
**Team Size:** 25+ (growing)
**Specialization:** Niche IT technologies (Guidewire, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Cloud, Data)

### Our Mission

## Our Differentiators

### 1. InTime Academy: We Build Our Talent

Unlike traditional recruiters who simply match resumes to job descriptions, InTime invests in training and certifying our own consultants through our proprietary academy program.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Quality Assurance:** Every consultant has been trained and vetted to our standards, not just matched by keyword
- **Consistency:** You know what you're getting—our academy standards are consistent across all placements
- **Capability Building:** Consultants join with core competencies that clients can build upon
- **Certification Proof:** Academy certification provides documented proof of skills and training

**Academy Focus Areas:**
- Guidewire (PolicyCenter, ClaimCenter, BillingCenter, Billing Center extensions)
- Salesforce (Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Financial Services Cloud, Insurance Cloud)
- ServiceNow (ITSM, ITOM, ITBM, Custom Applications)
- Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Data Engineering (Snowflake, Databricks, Informatica)

---

### 2. Technology-First Approach: Our Proprietary Platform

We've built a next-generation staffing platform that replaces legacy ATS systems (Bullhorn, Ceipal) with modern, AI-informed matching and faster submission workflows.

**Platform Capabilities:**
- **Smart Candidate Matching:** ML-powered matching beyond keyword searches
- **Real-Time Visibility:** Clients see recruitment progress in real-time, not via email
- **Automated Workflows:** Faster submissions, approvals, and onboarding

- **Integration:** Seamless integration with Client's HRIS and recruiting systems

**Client Benefit:** Faster fill times, better candidate quality, full transparency.

## Service Lines

### 1. Contract Staffing (W2)

**Full-time contractors placed as InTime employees.**

**How It Works:**

---

### 2. Contract Staffing (1099)

**Independent contractors placed on a 1099 basis.**

**Best For:** Specialized niche roles, when you want flexibility on terms, or when consultant already has established business entity.

**How It Works:**
- Consultant operates as independent contractor
- InTime acts as intermediary/recruiter
- Consultant invoices InTime for services
- InTime invoices you; you pay InTime
- Consultant handles their own taxes, benefits, insurance

**Rate Structure:** $40-70/hr to consultant (InTime margin typically 10-20%)

---

### 4. Contract-to-Hire

**Consultant starts on contract; if both sides agree, converts to permanent full-time hire.**

**Best For:** When you're evaluating fit before making permanent commitment; testing technology fit before building team.

**How It Works:**
- Consultant starts as W2 contractor for evaluation period (typically 60-90 days)
- At end of period, mutual decision: convert to permanent or part ways
- If converted, you pay InTime a conversion fee (declining scale: 30% → 25% → 20% → 15% over 12 months)
- InTime provides smooth transition (resignation assistance, background check for permanent role)

**Conversion Fee Structure:**
- Months 1-3: 30% of first-year salary
- Months 4-6: 25% of first-year salary
- Months 7-9: 20% of first-year salary

- After 12 months: No conversion fee

**Client Advantage:** De-risk permanent hiring; evaluate cultural and technical fit before committing.

---

### 5. Direct Hire / Full-Time Placement

**Permanent full-time placement with one-time recruitment fee.**

**Best For:** When you're ready to build permanent teams and want InTime's expertise in candidate evaluation.

**How It Works:**

- Weekly or monthly invoicing based on hours/deliverables
- Dedicated InTime Delivery Manager ensures quality and communication

**Client Advantage:** Complete team without multiple recruiting cycles; managed delivery accountability.

---

### 7. Training & Upskilling (InTime Academy)
