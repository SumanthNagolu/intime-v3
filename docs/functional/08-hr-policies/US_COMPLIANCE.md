# US Staffing Compliance Guide

## Overview

As a US IT staffing company operating from India, InTime must navigate a complex and evolving US regulatory landscape. This guide provides foundational knowledge on key compliance areas that impact our business model: employment classification, immigration, tax, employment law, and more.

**Why Compliance Matters**
- Misclassification fines: up to $50,000+ per violation
- Immigration penalties: $15,000-$35,000+ per unauthorized worker
- Wage/hour violations: treble damages + penalties
- Reputational damage and client loss
- Loss of ability to operate in US market

### Key Regulatory Bodies
- **DOL (Department of Labor)**: Wage & hour, OSHA, ETA
- **USCIS (US Citizenship & Immigration Services)**: Work authorization, I-9 verification
- **IRS (Internal Revenue Service)**: Tax withholding, form 1099/W-2 reporting
- **EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission)**: Anti-discrimination, sexual harassment
- **State Labor Departments**: State-specific wage laws, unemployment insurance
- **State Tax Agencies**: State income tax, state employment taxes

## Employment Types and Classification

### Overview of Employment Categories

InTime engages talent in three primary employment arrangements:

1. **W-2 Employees** (InTime is employer of record)
2. **1099 Independent Contractors** (C2C arrangements)
3. **Corp-to-Corp** (C2C placements at US companies)

### W-2 Employees

**Definition**: Individual is on InTime's payroll. InTime is the employer of record and responsible for withholding taxes, paying employment taxes, providing benefits.

**When Used**: Direct hires, Academy graduates going into bench, dedicated team members

**InTime Responsibilities**
- W-4 form completion
- Federal income tax withholding
- FICA (Social Security + Medicare) withholding and matching
- FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax) payment
- State income tax withholding
- State unemployment insurance (SUTA)
- Workers' compensation insurance
- I-9 verification
- Form W-2 reporting year-end

**Employee Rights**
- Minimum wage compliance
- Overtime pay (if non-exempt)
- Workers' compensation coverage
- Anti-discrimination protections
- Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) eligibility
- Unemployment insurance eligibility
- Benefits eligibility (if offered)

**Compliance Checklist**
- [ ] Complete I-9 within 3 days of hire
- [ ] Obtain W-4 (federal) and state tax forms
- [ ] Register with state unemployment agency
- [ ] Set up payroll processing
- [ ] Provide employee handbook/onboarding
- [ ] Ensure wage/hour compliance
- [ ] Maintain personnel files securely
- [ ] File W-2s by January 31

---

### 1099 Independent Contractors

**Definition**: Individual is self-employed; InTime is not the employer. Contractor is responsible for self-employment taxes and benefits.

**When Used**: Specialized roles, short-term projects, high-wage professionals, Guidewire consultants

**Misclassification Risks**: Highest area of scrutiny by DOL and IRS. Misclassification can result in:
- Back taxes and penalties
- FUTA and SUTA liability
- Wage/hour liability if worker is entitled to overtime
- Treble damages for willful violations

### Classification Tests

#### IRS 20-Factor Test
The IRS uses a 20-factor test to determine worker status. Factors favoring employee classification:

**Behavioral Control** (IRS weighs most heavily)
1. Contractor is subject to detailed instructions (employee trait)
2. Worker receives extensive training (employee trait)
3. Worker's services are integrated into business operations (employee trait)
4. Worker provides services personally (not subcontractible) (employee trait)
5. Hiring/supervising assistants is done by company (employee trait)
6. Relationship is continuous rather than project-based (employee trait)

**Financial Control**
7. Worker's significant investment in tools/equipment (contractor trait)
8. Worker can suffer financial loss or realize profit (contractor trait)
9. Worker is paid by time vs. by job (time = employee trait)
10. Worker is reimbursed for unreimbursed expenses (employee trait)
11. Worker cannot control business aspects (employee trait)

**Nature of Relationship**
12. Worker provides exclusive services to company (employee trait)
13. Relationship is permanent/indefinite (employee trait)
14. Services are key to core business operations (employee trait)
15. Company provides worker benefits (employee trait)
16. Either party cannot terminate relationship without liability (employee trait)
17. Parties act as if employee/employer (employee trait)
18. Worker is on company premises (employee trait)
19. Company requires attendance at meetings/training (employee trait)
20. Company controls assignment and supervision (employee trait)

**Analysis**: No single factor is determinative. IRS weighs behavioral control most heavily, then financial control, then relationship factors. Majority of factors favoring employee status suggests misclassification.

#### ABC Test (Some States)
More favorable to contractors than IRS test. Applied in California and some other states.

Worker is contractor if:
- **(A) Control**: Worker is not under control/direction of company
- **(B) Business Scope**: Worker's work is outside company's usual business
- **(C) Business**: Worker is engaged in independently established business in that field

If all three elements met, contractor classification is likely valid in that state.

#### Economic Reality Test (Courts)
Focuses on whether worker is economically dependent on company:
- Worker's bargaining power
- Worker's ability to set own rates
- Worker's ability to work for competitors
- Worker's investment in business
- Permanence of relationship

### Safe Harbor Provisions

IRS Statutory Safe Harbor (Section 530 Relief):
- If company reasonably relied on judicial precedent, IRS ruling, or past practice
- If company reports worker as independent contractor consistently
- If company files Form 1099-NEC for worker
- Then company may avoid reclassification and penalties (though may owe back taxes)

**Important**: Section 530 relief is being reduced under new proposed rules. Do not rely heavily on safe harbor.

### Guidelines for InTime

**Use 1099 Classification When**:
- High-level expertise (rare, specialized skills)
- Short-term projects (less than 1 year)
- Contractor explicitly runs own business (has other clients)
- Contractor has significant autonomy and control
- Contractor absorbs business risk
- Contractor provides own tools/equipment

**Use W-2 Classification When**:
- Worker is on bench or needs ongoing work
- InTime exerts significant control over work
- Worker is core to operations
- Long-term relationship expected
- Worker receives extensive training from InTime
- Worker cannot work for competitors

**Red Flag Contractors**:
- Only work for InTime (not truly independent)
- Receive detailed instructions on how to work
- Required to work certain hours
- Company provides equipment and tools
- Worker is integrated into team
- Company restricts other client work

### State-Specific Rules

**California AB5 (Effective January 2020)**
- Codified ABC test into law
- Applied broadly to many workers including gig economy
- Strongest protection for worker classification as employee
- Limited exceptions only for specific professions (include "professional services" exception if properly applied)
- If operating in California, use ABC test as baseline

**New York**
- Uses "Suffer or Permit" test (very broad, employee-friendly)
- Virtually any level of control makes worker an employee
- Burden on company to show contractor status

**Massachusetts**
- Uses derivative of ABC test
- Recently tightened contractor classification

**Texas**
- More contractor-friendly
- No specific statute; relies on common law

**Other States**
- Varying tests and tolerances
- General trend toward stricter contractor classification
- Many states transitioning to ABC-like tests

---

### Corp-to-Corp (C2C) Arrangements

**Definition**: InTime places contractor as independent contractor firm, not individual. Contractor operates as sole proprietor (1099) or registered business entity (C-corp, S-corp, LLC).

**Structure**:
- Individual contractor operates as business entity
- Business entity contracts with client for staffing services
- InTime may act as broker or MSP (Managed Service Provider)
- Contractor handles own taxes, business licenses, insurance

**Benefits**:
- Clearer contractor/employee distinction
- Contractor assumes business obligations
- Reduces InTime liability for employment law
- Often preferred by companies for specialized roles

**Risks**:
- Client may be viewed as joint employer
- State may pierce corporate veil and claim employee status
- Must ensure contractor legitimately operates as business (not sham)
- Contractor must have other clients to prove independence

**InTime Considerations**:
- Obtain W-9 from contractor's business
- Get Certificate of Insurance showing contractor's coverage
- Contract must clearly state independent contractor relationship
- Document contractor's other business operations
- Do not control contractor's means/methods of work

---

## Immigration Compliance

### Overview

As US company placing workers, InTime must ensure work authorization and comply with immigration laws. Violations can result in:
- Company fines: $15,000-$35,000+ per unauthorized worker
- Criminal prosecution
- Debarment from federal contracts
- Reputation damage

### Work Authorization Verification (I-9 Process)

**Requirement**: Every employee hired in US must complete I-9 within 3 days of hire.

**Process**:
1. Employee completes Section 1 of Form I-9
2. Employer reviews Section 2 documents within 3 days
3. Employer verifies documents and completes Section 2
4. Employer retains I-9 for 3 years from hire date or 1 year from termination date (whichever is later)

**Acceptable Documents (Section 2)** - Must present:
- **List A** (Identity + Work Authorization): Passport, Green Card, Permanent Resident Card, Employment Authorization Document (EAD), Form I-766, Certificate of Naturalization, or unexpired state driver's license/ID + Social Security card
- **List B** (Identity): State driver's license, US military ID, passport, permanent resident card, other government-issued ID
- **List C** (Work Authorization): Social Security card, birth certificate, employment authorization document, etc.

**Common Employee Types & Accepted Documents**:
- **US Citizen**: Passport, state driver's license + Social Security card, or birth certificate + state ID
- **Lawful Permanent Resident (Green Card holder)**: Green Card (valid for I-9 purposes, shows both identity and work authorization)
- **OPT Worker (EAD Card)**: Employment Authorization Document (EAD card) showing "Valid for work only with [Employer Name]" if restricted
- **H-1B Worker**: Passport + I-797B (H-1B approval notice) or visa stamp + I-797B
- **TN Visa (Canadian/Mexican)**: Passport + TN visa stamp + letter from employer

**Critical Compliance Points**:
- Do NOT accept copies of documents (must see originals, though may photocopy for records)
- Do NOT require specific documents (must allow employee to choose from acceptable lists)
- Do NOT re-verify I-9 unless employment authorization expires (no reverification needed for permanent residents or citizens)
- Keep I-9s in separate employee files
- Do NOT discriminate based on appearance or accent (violation of anti-discrimination rules)

### E-Verify

**What is E-Verify?**
- Voluntary (in most states) electronic system administered by USCIS and SSA
- Verifies I-9 documents against SSA and USCIS records
- Can identify fraudulent or incorrect documents before issues arise

**InTime Approach**:
- Optional for most states; required for federal contractors
- Best practice to use for all hires to reduce risk
- Use as supplementary check, not replacement for I-9
- Results available in seconds to minutes

**E-Verify Process**:
1. Complete I-9 first
2. Employer initiates E-Verify case with employee information
3. System provides automatic results (most cases confirmed immediately)
4. If tentative non-confirmation, employee has 8 days to contest
5. If not resolved, employer may not continue employment

---

### H-1B Visa Workers

**Overview**
- Specialty occupation visa for workers with bachelor's degree+ in required field
- 3-year initial validity, can be extended to 6 years total
- Employer must sponsor and file petition with USCIS
- Subject to annual cap (usually filled quickly)

**Employer Obligations**:
1. **Labor Condition Application (LCA)**
   - Filed with DOL before USCIS petition
   - Employer certifies:
     - Wage offered is at least prevailing wage for role/location (or higher of prevailing wage / actual wage paid for similar role)
     - Working conditions will not negatively impact US workers
     - Notice of LCA filing was posted at worksite
     - Employer has offered position to available US workers
   - LCA valid for 3 years; must renew if petition extends

2. **H-1B Petition (I-129)**
   - Filed with USCIS once LCA approved
   - Includes job description, education requirements, proof of specialty occupation
   - Petitioner liability if conditions change

3. **Public Access File**
   - Maintain at principal place of business
   - File must include: LCA, prevailing wage determination, job description, recruiting documentation
   - Accessible to labor dept on request

4. **Wage Requirements**
   - Cannot pay less than prevailing wage for role/location/experience
   - Prevailing wage is NOT minimum wage; often $60K-$120K+ depending on field
   - Portal: oflc.dol.gov for prevailing wage lookup by state/job
   - Document prevailing wage determination; pay H-1B at or above

5. **Site Visit Audit Risk**
   - DOL may conduct site visits to verify:
     - Worker is performing duties described in petition
     - Pay records match stated wages
     - Work conditions match LCA certifications
     - Worker is not displacing US employees
   - Non-compliance can result in fines, potential fraud charges

**Compliance Checklist**:
- [ ] LCA filing with prevailing wage determination
- [ ] H-1B petition approved by USCIS before employment starts
- [ ] Wage paid matches or exceeds prevailing wage
- [ ] Public access file maintained with required documents
- [ ] Work authorization document (Form I-94, I-797) on file
- [ ] Worker has valid passport
- [ ] Annual salary documentation

**Guidewire Staffing Consideration**: H-1B workers are common in Guidewire consulting roles. InTime must ensure proper LCA filing and wage compliance for each H-1B contractor.

---

### OPT/CPT Workers (F-1 Visa)

**Overview**
- Optional Practical Training (OPT): Work authorization for recent graduates
- Curricular Practical Training (CPT): Work authorization while student
- Valid for 12 months (STEM OPT: 24-36 months with extension)
- Issued as Employment Authorization Document (EAD card)

**Employer Obligations**:
1. **Verify EAD Card**
   - I-9 requirement: EAD card or approval notice
   - Check expiration date
   - Verify "Valid for work only with [Employer Name]" if applicable

2. **Employment Restrictions**
   - OPT work must be directly related to field of study
   - OPT duration is limited (12 months base + STEM extension)
   - Cannot renew EAD once expired (must either find new OPT employer or leave US)
   - If working on restricted EAD, cannot work for other employers

3. **Employer Reporting**
   - Some employers must report OPT hires to USCIS (Form I-765 amendments)
   - Check if InTime is required to report

4. **STEM OPT Extension**
   - If worker has STEM degree and employed in STEM role, eligible for 24-month extension
   - Requires employer participation and specific notifications
   - Common for Guidewire training (qualifies as IT field)

**Key Point**: OPT workers cannot transition directly to H-1B or other visa without leaving US and applying from abroad (few exceptions). Plan carefully if hiring OPT worker.

---

### Green Card Holders & US Citizens

**Work Authorization**
- Green Card (Permanent Resident Card): Indefinite work authorization
- US Citizen: Unlimited work authorization
- No work authorization documentation renewal needed
- I-9 verification is standard but no special compliance

**Benefits for InTime**:
- No visa sponsorship required
- No prevailing wage requirements
- Maximum flexibility and lower compliance burden
- Can work for any employer without restrictions

---

### TN Visa (NAFTA/USMCA)

- [ ] Degree documentation on file
- [ ] Employment authorization (TN stamp) valid
- [ ] No work restrictions beyond employer change requires new TN status

---

### Monitoring Work Authorization Status

**For All Work-Authorized Employees**:
1. Track expiration dates of work authorization
2. Notify employee of expiration well in advance
3. For H-1B: File extension petition before expiration
4. For OPT: Advise of limitations and transition options
5. For TN: Facilitate renewal process if continuing employment

**Best Practices**:
- Spreadsheet tracking all work authorization expiration dates
- Calendar reminders 6-9 months before expiration
- Proactive communication with employees
- Legal review before employment extensions

---

### Anti-Discrimination in Immigration Compliance

**Critical**: Cannot discriminate based on national origin, accent, or perceived immigration status.

**Do Not**:
- Require citizenship or specific visa status unless required by law
- Ask about immigration status before hire (unless through I-9)
- Request more documentation from certain national origin groups
- Discriminate in hiring based on accent or accent-based communication style
- Treat similarly situated employees differently based on immigration status

**Protected**: Employers CAN require work authorization and can prefer/hire based on legally required criteria (e.g., require H-1B sponsorship if not available).

---

## Tax Compliance

### Federal Tax Withholding (W-2 Employees)

**Requirements**:
- Withhold federal income tax based on W-4 form
- Withhold Social Security (6.2% of wages up to $168,600 in 2024)
- Withhold Medicare (1.45% of all wages + 0.9% additional for wages > $200K)
- Remit withheld taxes to IRS (monthly or semi-weekly depending on amount)

**Processing**:
1. New employee completes Form W-4 (employee adjusts withholding)
2. Employer calculates withholding using IRS tables or software
3. Employer remits withholding to IRS (EFTPS or through payroll processor)
4. Employer withholds additional Social Security for employee payroll taxes
5. Year-end: Issue Form W-2 by January 31

**Key Rates (2024)**:
- Federal income tax: Varies by bracket and W-4
- Social Security: 6.2% employee + 6.2% employer (self-employed 15.3%)
- Medicare: 1.45% employee + 1.45% employer
- Additional Medicare: 0.9% employee on wages > $200K (threshold $250K for joint filers)

---

### Self-Employment Tax (1099 Contractors)

**Requirements**:
- Contractor responsible for calculating and paying self-employment tax
- Self-employment tax (Social Security + Medicare): 15.3% of net earnings
- Contractor may deduct employer-equivalent portion (6.2%)
- Quarterly estimated tax payments typically required

**1099 Reporting**:
- InTime must issue Form 1099-NEC if contractor paid $600+ in calendar year
- Due to contractor by January 31
- Copy to IRS by February 28
- Keep records of amounts paid

**InTime Form 1099 Process**:
1. Obtain W-9 from contractor before engaging
2. Track payments to contractor during year
3. Prepare Form 1099-NEC with contractor's name, EIN/SSN, amount paid
4. Deliver by January 31 (best practice: earlier if possible)
5. IRS copy due by February 28
6. Maintain backup documentation of payments

---

### State Tax Considerations

**Key Variables**:
- **Work State vs. Residence State**: Generally, employee owes taxes to work state
- **Multi-State Employment**: Potential obligation in multiple states
- **Remote Work**: Recent changes favor work location for tax purposes

**InTime Considerations**:
- InTime staff in India: No US state tax obligation
- Contractor clients across US: Various state work locations
- Contractor taxes: Usually contractor's responsibility (but verify in contract)

**State Income Tax**:
- Most states impose income tax on employee earnings
- InTime must withhold if employee works in state
- No income tax states (TX, FL, WA, NV, SD, TN, WY): No state withholding
- Multi-state withholding can be complex

**State Employment Taxes (SUTA)**:
- Employer must register with state unemployment agency
- Pay unemployment insurance tax (typically 0.6%-6% depending on industry/history)
- Used to fund unemployment benefits
- Track payroll by state for proper SUTA allocation

**Payroll Tax Remittance**:
- Monthly or quarterly depending on total payroll
- Use payroll software to track and remit
- Penalties for late payment
- Penalties for under-withholding

---

### Multi-State Tax Obligations

**Example Scenario**: InTime employee works for clients in New York, California, Texas

**Tax Obligation**:
- Federal taxes: Withheld based on W-4
- New York: Withhold NY income tax + SUTA
- California: Withhold CA income tax + SUTA
- Texas: No income tax, but SUTA may apply

**Complexity**: Multi-state payroll requires:
- Allocation methodology (time tracking)
- Different withholding rates by state
- SUTA allocation across states
- Compliance with each state's requirements

**InTime Approach**:
- Use payroll processor experienced with multi-state
- Track hours by work state
- Maintain records for audit trail
- Consult tax professional for complex situations

---

## Employment Law Compliance

### At-Will Employment

**Default Rule (US)**:
- Employees employed "at will" unless contract specifies otherwise
- Employer can terminate for any lawful reason or no reason
- Employee can terminate for any reason

**Exceptions by State**:
- **Public Policy Exception**: Cannot terminate for unlawful reason (e.g., reporting illegal conduct, serving jury duty)
- **Implied Contract**: Handbook or oral statements may create enforceable contract
- **Good Faith & Fair Dealing**: Some states recognize implied covenant

**InTime Implication**:
- Maintain at-will employment statement in offer letter and handbook
- Avoid statements implying employment security ("permanent position")
- Document termination reasons for compliance
- Recognize state-specific exceptions

---

### Anti-Discrimination Laws

**Key Statutes**:
- **Title VII (1964)**: Prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin
- **ADEA (1967)**: Age discrimination (40+ years old)
- **ADA (1990)**: Disability discrimination
- **GINA (2008)**: Genetic information discrimination
- **State Laws**: Additional protections (marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc.)

**Prohibited Discrimination**:
- Hiring, compensation, termination, assignment, training
- Harassment based on protected class
- Retaliation for reporting discrimination
- "Mixed motive" cases (both lawful and unlawful reasons)

**InTime Compliance**:
- Non-discrimination policy in handbook
- Training for all decision-makers
- Consistent application of policies
- Documented reasons for employment decisions
- Anti-retaliation protection
- Complaint procedures and investigation

**High-Risk Areas**:
- Age (don't target older workers for termination)
- Pregnancy discrimination (illegal, extends 12 months post-partum)
- Disability accommodations (interactive process required)
- Religious accommodations (unless undue hardship)
- Gender identity and sexual orientation (expanding protections)

---

### Equal Pay Act & Pay Equity

**Requirement**:
- Equal pay for equal work (substantially similar, not identical)
- Applied regardless of job title
- Covers wages, bonuses, overtime, stock options

**Defenses**:
- Different in seniority system, merit system, production-based system, or other job-related factors
- Pay differential NOT based on sex

**Burden of Proof**:
- Employee: Must show substantially similar jobs
- Employer: Can defend if factors other than sex explain differential

**InTime Risk Areas**:
- Ensure men and women in similar roles paid similarly
- Review 1099 contractor rates for potential sex-based disparities
- Document any legitimate pay differences

**Recent Trend**: State pay transparency laws require salary disclosure in job postings (California, Colorado, New York, etc.). Review before posting jobs.

---

### Sexual Harassment & Hostile Work Environment

**Legal Standard (Title VII)**:
- Unwelcome sexual conduct, requests, advances
- Severe or pervasive enough to alter terms/conditions of employment
- Employer knew or should have known; failed to remedy

**Types**:
- Quid pro quo (job benefit conditioned on sexual conduct)
- Hostile environment (pervasive harassment affecting work)
- Same-sex harassment (illegal under Title VII)

**Employer Liability**:
- Vicarious liability for supervisor harassment (strict liability)
- Negligence liability for co-worker/third-party harassment
- Preventive measures and prompt remediation reduce liability

**InTime Prevention**:
- Clear anti-harassment policy
- Mandatory harassment training (required in some states)
- Reporting procedures that allow reporting to non-supervisor
- Confidentiality where possible
- Investigation procedures (prompt, impartial, documented)
- No retaliation for complaints
- Document all actions

---

### Wage and Hour (FLSA)

**Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)**:
- Federal baseline; states may impose stricter requirements
- Controls hours, overtime, minimum wage, child labor

**Exempt vs. Non-Exempt**:
- **Non-exempt**: Entitled to overtime, minimum wage, breaks
- **Exempt**: Excepted from overtime if meet tests

**Exempt Tests** (MUST MEET ALL):
1. Salary level: Paid at least $35,568/year federal minimum (state may be higher)
2. Salary basis: Paid salary (not hourly), not reduced for hours worked
3. Duties test:
   - **Executive**: Manage 2+ employees + supervise department
   - **Professional**: Requires advanced degree + professional work
   - **Administrative**: Responsible work in office/business
   - **Sales**: Primary duty is sales + customary commissions

**Critical**: Misclassification is common violation. If worker doesn't meet ALL three tests, must pay overtime.

**Overtime**:
- Non-exempt employees: Paid 1.5x rate for hours over 40/week
- Compensation: Straight time must be at least minimum wage
- Averaging: Cannot average hours over multiple weeks to avoid overtime
- Voluntary overtime: Still must pay overtime (employer cannot waive)

**Minimum Wage**:
- Federal: $7.25/hour (many states higher)
- States: Often $12-17/hour in higher-cost areas
- Local: Some cities have city minimum (higher than state)
- Work state controls: Apply minimum wage of work state (not residence state)

**Breaks & Meal Periods**:
- Federal: No federal requirement for breaks
- States: Many states require breaks (10-15 min per 4 hours), meal periods
- Paid vs. unpaid: Depends on state law
- On-call time: Usually not compensable

**InTime Staffing Implications**:
- Contractor classification helps avoid FLSA (contractor not entitled to overtime)
- W-2 employees on bench: Still entitled to minimum wage for bench time? Check if bench time is "work"
- Candidates placed at clients: InTime liable for wage/hour violations if InTime controls worker (co-employment risk)

---

### State-Specific Wage Laws

**California**: Notably strict wage/hour law
- Minimum wage: $16.50+ (effective 2024)
- Overtime: 1.5x for hours over 8/day AND 40/week (whichever is greater)
- Meal periods: 30-minute unpaid for 5+ hours, 10-minute paid
- Daily rest breaks: 10 minutes paid per 4 hours
- Waiting time: Can be compensable if on-call
- Retaliation: Very employee-friendly retaliation statutes

**New York**: Progressively stricter
- Minimum wage: $15+ (higher in NYC, upstate)
- Overtime: 1.5x for hours over 40/week
- Spread of hours: Minimum wage for spread time in certain industries
- Overtime recovery: 6-year statute of limitations (generous to employees)

**Texas**: Minimal protections
- Follows federal FLSA strictly
- No state income tax
- Generally employer-friendly

**Massachusetts, Washington, Colorado**: Middle ground with progressive trends toward worker protections

**General Trend**: States are increasing minimum wage, expanding overtime, requiring paid leave. InTime should plan for stricter standards.

---

### Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)

**Coverage**:
- Employers with 50+ employees within 75 miles
- Private, public, and government employers
- Applies to all employees (union and non-union)

**Entitlement**:
- 12 weeks unpaid leave per 12-month period for qualifying reason
- Job protection (must be returned to same/equivalent position)
- Health insurance maintained during leave

**Qualifying Reasons**:
- Birth/adoption of child
- Care for spouse, child, or parent with serious health condition
- Worker's own serious health condition
- Military family leave (spouse/child military)
- Qualifying exigency (military)

**Serious Health Condition**:
- Requires continuing treatment
- 3+ days incapacity + treatment within 30 days OR chronic condition
- Does not include minor cold/flu

**InTime Implications**:
- If InTime reaches 50+ employees, FMLA applies
- Must allow 12-week leave; cannot force vacation first
- Must maintain benefits during leave
- Must notify employees of rights
- Document FMLA requests and compliance

---

### Retaliation & Whistleblower Protections

**Broad Protection**: Many statutes prohibit retaliation for:
- Filing wage/hour claim
- Reporting unsafe conditions (OSHA)
- Reporting discrimination
- Refusing illegal conduct
- Requesting religious accommodation
- Jury duty, military service, voting

**Legal Standard**:
- Protected activity (reporting, filing, requesting accommodation, etc.)
- Adverse employment action (termination, demotion, reduced hours)
- Causal connection between activity and action

**InTime Risk Areas**:
- Do not terminate worker for reporting wage/hour issue
- Do not retaliate against contractor for reporting labor law violation
- Do not retaliate for EEOC complaint
- Document non-retaliatory reasons for all adverse actions

**Documentation**: If adverse action, document legitimate business reason BEFORE action, not after.

---

### Background Checks & FCRA Compliance

**Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)**:
- Applies to criminal, credit, employment background checks
- Requires authorization before obtaining report
- Requires notice if report will be used for hiring decision
- Requires notice BEFORE adverse action based on report
- Employee can dispute report accuracy

**Requirements**:
1. **Disclosure & Authorization**:
   - Separate, clear, and conspicuous authorization
   - Cannot be part of application
   - Must explain report may affect employment

2. **Notice Before Adverse Action**:
   - If not hiring based on report, must notify employee
   - Provide copy of report and FCRA notice
   - Give time to dispute accuracy

3. **Final Adverse Action Notice**:
   - Confirm not hiring/terminating based on report
   - Cannot claim report was inaccurate if employee has not disputed

**Ban the Box Laws**:
- Many states/cities prohibit asking about criminal history upfront
- Can only ask after conditional offer
- Must follow specific notice and opportunity to explain

## Benefits Compliance

### ACA (Affordable Care Act) Requirements

**Applicable Large Employers (ALE)**:
- 50+ full-time equivalent employees (FTE)
- Trigger shared responsibility penalties if:
  - Don't offer health insurance to 95%+ of full-time employees, or
  - Offer but is unaffordable (> 9.5% of household income) or doesn't meet minimum value (60% cost coverage)

**InTime Status** (Phase 1): <50 employees, so ACA requirements don't apply currently.

**Future Consideration**: As InTime grows, ACA may apply. Plan healthcare offering in advance.

---

### COBRA

**Overview**:
- Continuation of group health plan coverage after qualifying event
- Applies to employers with 20+ employees
- Allows employee to maintain coverage for 18-36 months

**Qualifying Events**:
- Job termination (not for cause)
- Reduction in hours
- Death of employee
- Divorce/legal separation
- Child loss of dependent status
- Medicare eligibility

**Employer Obligations**:
- Notify employee of COBRA rights within 14 days of qualifying event
- Employee may elect continuation within 60 days
- Must maintain coverage while premium paid
- Can charge employee + 2% administrative fee

**InTime Considerations**:
- As staffing company, likely have contract workers subject to COBRA
- Track terminations and qualifying events
- Provide timely COBRA notices
- Maintain records

---

### State-Mandated Benefits

**State Requirements**:
- California: 3 paid sick days/year (or 5 + 2 for other purposes)
- New York: 4-7 paid sick days
- Washington: Paid family/medical leave (10-12 weeks)

**InTime Approach**:
- Monitor states where employees work
- Implement applicable leave policies
- Track and document leave usage
- Ensure no discriminatory application

---

### Workers' Compensation

**Overview**:
- Mandatory in all states (except few exceptions)
- Provides benefits for work-related injuries/illness
- Funded by employer (cost varies by state and industry)
- Injury = medical care + wage replacement

**Employer Obligations**:
- Obtain workers' comp insurance
- Register with state division
- Post notice of coverage
- Report injuries promptly
- Cooperate with insurer
- No retaliation for injury claims

**Premiums**:
- Vary by state, industry, claims history

- 1099 contractors typically responsible for own coverage (confirm in contract)
- Placement staff at clients: Who carries coverage? Clarify in MSA

---

## Insurance Requirements

### General Liability Insurance

**Purpose**: Covers bodily injury or property damage caused by company

**Typical Coverage**: $1-2 million per occurrence

**InTime Need**: Standard for staffing operations

---

## Client Contract Compliance

### Non-Solicitation Clauses

**Definition**: Restricts candidate from working for client without permission/payment

**Enforceability**: Varies dramatically by state

**High Enforcement States**: Virginia, Delaware
**Medium Enforcement States**: Texas, New York
**Low Enforcement States**: California (very restrictive on non-competes)

**Key Factors for Enforceability**:
- Reasonable scope (not forever)
- Reasonable geographic scope
- Protects legitimate business interest
- Not unduly burdensome on employee
- Proper notice to employee

**Typical Terms**: 12-24 months, specific job titles, reasonable scope

**InTime Risk Management**:
- State law controls (not InTime's choice); consult counsel
- Ensure candidate and client sign agreement
- Define "solicitation" clearly (passive vs. active recruiting)
- Include conversion fee if clause enforced
- Document enforcement efforts

**Conversion Fees**: If candidate placed and later hires directly (avoiding fee), InTime can claim conversion fee (typically 10-25% of first-year salary).

---

### Non-Compete Clauses (Declining Enforceability)

**Overview**:
- Restrict employee from working for competitor
- Historically enforceable in many states
- Declining enforceability, especially for lower-wage employees

**Recent Developments**:
- FTC rule (effective September 2024): Proposed ban on most non-competes
- Some states (California, North Dakota) ban almost entirely
- Other states require new consideration, limited scope
- Trend: Less enforceable, especially for non-executives

**InTime Approach**:
- Avoid non-competes if possible (many states won't enforce anyway)
- If necessary, limit to executives, trade secret positions
- Ensure reasonable scope and duration
- Provide consideration (new job, promotion, bonus)
- Consult counsel in specific state

---

### IP Ownership & Work Product

**Default Rule**: Company owns work created by employee within scope of employment

**Best Practice**: Have employee sign IP assignment confirming:
- Work created is company property
- Employee waives any rights to IP
- Includes pre-existing IP if used in work

**InTime Implication**: If developing proprietary platform, ensure employee/contractor IP assignments are clear.

---

## Red Flags & Risk Areas

### Worker Misclassification Indicators

**High Risk**: Classifying as 1099 when meeting employee factors

**Red Flags**:
- Contractor only works for InTime, not truly independent
- Work is core to InTime's business operations
- InTime provides detailed instructions on how to work
- Contractor cannot work for competitors
- InTime provides tools/equipment
- Work is long-term/indefinite
- Contractor integrated into team

**Response**: If any flag present, consider W-2 classification or restructure relationship for legitimate C2C.

---

### Immigration Document Fraud

**Red Flags**:
- Document appears altered or forged
- Photo doesn't match person
- Information inconsistent across documents
- Unusual or suspicious circumstances

**Response**:
- Do not hire if document appears fraudulent
- Do not initiate employment
- Consider reporting to USCIS (I-9 fraud is crime)
- Consult legal counsel

---

### Timesheet Manipulation

**Red Flags**:
- Timesheets approved after work performed (vs. contemporaneous)
- Timesheets consistently show exactly 40 hours
- Hours don't match client records
- Overtime discrepancies
- Unexplained gaps in timesheets

**Response**:
- Investigate discrepancies
- Require contractor/employee explanations

---

### Retaliation Risks

**Scenarios**:
- Candidate complains about wage/hour issue, later terminated

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Document legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for decisions
- Investigate complaints thoroughly
- Take corrective action (not punitive)
- No adverse action without clear documentation

---

### Co-Employment Risks

- Commingling of staff (InTime staff on client premises)

**Liability**: Joint employers responsible for wage/hour, anti-discrimination, benefits

**Mitigation**:
- Clear contract defining roles (client controls day-to-day; InTime controls payroll/benefits)
- Staffing company independent contractor status emphasized
- Worker should understand client is actual manager
- Avoid InTime involvement in discipline/termination decisions
- Regular audit of control and interaction

---

### Data Breaches & Privacy Violations

**Risk Areas**:
- Candidate data breach (personal info, SSN, background)
