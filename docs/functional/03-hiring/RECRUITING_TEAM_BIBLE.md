*The definitive guide to building and running our staffing operations team.*

---

## Part I: Who We Are

### Our Mission

**Help IT professionals build meaningful careers and help companies build exceptional teams.**

We are not just "filling positions" - we are:
- Career architects for candidates
- Strategic partners for clients
- The bridge between talent and opportunity

### Our Vision

**Become the staffing partner that technology companies trust most.**

Within 3 years:

### What Makes Us Different

|---------------------|------------|
| Volume over quality | Quality over volume |
| Transactional relationships | Long-term partnerships |
| Reactive sourcing | Proactive pool building |
| Resume spam | Pre-qualified matches |
| "Fire and forget" placements | Active delivery management |
| Fragmented tools | One unified platform |

---

## Part II: Our Values

### 1. Candidates First

**We succeed when our candidates succeed.**

- Every candidate is a person with a career, not a "resource"
- We only submit candidates for roles where they can thrive
- We provide honest feedback, even when it's hard
- We prepare candidates to succeed, not just to get placed
- We stay connected after placement

**In practice:**
- Never submit a candidate without speaking to them first
- Never oversell a candidate's skills to a client
- Always follow up within 24 hours of an interview
- Always advocate for fair compensation

### 2. Earn Trust Daily

**Trust is built through consistent actions, not promises.**

- We do what we say we'll do, every time
- We communicate proactively - clients never have to chase us
- We admit mistakes quickly and fix them faster
- We're transparent about challenges and timelines

**In practice:**
- Respond to client inquiries within 2 hours during business hours
- Update candidates on their status at least weekly
- If we can't fill a role, say so early rather than string along
- Own problems - never blame candidates, clients, or colleagues

### 3. Speed Without Shortcuts

**Fast is good. Fast and right is better.**

- Every hour matters in recruiting - top talent moves quickly
- Speed comes from preparation, not from skipping steps
- First to submit quality wins; first to submit garbage loses trust
- Urgency is constant; panic is not

**In practice:**
- First qualified submission within 24 hours of job intake
- Pre-qualify candidates before you need them
- Respond to hot requirements within 1 hour
- Never skip screening steps just to be first

### 4. Own It End-to-End

**The job isn't done when the candidate starts. It's done when they succeed.**

- Recruiters own candidate relationships from first contact through placement success
- Account Managers own client relationships from first meeting through renewal
- Every placement is a promise we must keep
- Problems are opportunities to prove our value

**In practice:**
- Check in with placements at week 1, month 1, month 3
- Proactively address issues before they escalate
- Never say "that's not my job"
- Celebrate placement success, not just placement start

### 5. Better Every Day

**Good today. Better tomorrow. Excellent next month.**

- Every call is practice for the next one
- Every rejection is a lesson
- Every placement teaches us something
- Feedback is a gift - seek it out

**In practice:**
- Debrief every lost deal - what could we have done differently?
- Share successful approaches with the team
- Ask candidates and clients for feedback regularly
- Track and improve personal metrics weekly

### 6. Win as a Team

**Individual stars don't make championships. Teams do.**

- Share candidates, don't hoard them
- Help colleagues hit their goals
- Celebrate team wins loudly; handle individual struggles privately
- Competition is with other agencies, not each other

**In practice:**
- If you can't fill a job, give it to someone who can
- Share your best sourcing strategies
- Cover for colleagues when they're overwhelmed
- Success stories are "we did this," not "I did this"
