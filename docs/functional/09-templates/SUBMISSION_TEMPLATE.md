3. **Professional Tone**: Keep language professional, concise, and focused on job-relevant qualifications.

### Section-Specific Instructions

**Submission Header**:
- Copy Job ID from intake form
- Verify client contact information before submitting
- Record the date and time of submission

**Skills Matrix**:
- Include only skills relevant to the job description
- Be specific (e.g., "Guidewire PolicyCenter" not just "Guidewire")
- Use recent experience dates; if skill hasn't been used in >2 years, flag as "somewhat dated"

- For each role, clearly separate project scope from individual contributions

**Education & Certifications**:
- List degrees in reverse chronological order
- Include GPA only if 3.5+ or specifically requested by client
- Separate certifications from formal education

**References**:
- Always get permission from references before submitting

- Note any references who are difficult to reach (helpful for client)

**Internal Notes**:
