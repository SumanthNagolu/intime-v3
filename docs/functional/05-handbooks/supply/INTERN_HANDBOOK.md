## Part 2: Industry Knowledge

### How Staffing Works

**The Simple Version:**
```
Company needs worker → Staffing agency finds worker →
Worker works at company → Company pays agency →
Agency pays worker → Agency keeps the difference (margin)
```

**The Players:**
| Player | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Client** | Company that needs workers |
| **Candidate** | Professional looking for work |
| **Recruiter** | Finds and qualifies candidates |
| **Vendor (us)** | Agency that supplies workers |
| **Prime Vendor** | Direct relationship with client |
| **Sub-Vendor** | Works through prime vendor |

### How We Make Money

**The Math:**
```
Client pays:     $75/hour (Bill Rate)
Candidate gets:  $60/hour (Pay Rate)
We keep:         $15/hour (Spread/Margin)

If candidate works 40 hrs/week:
Weekly margin = $15 × 40 = $600
Monthly margin = $600 × 4 = $2,400
Annual margin = $2,400 × 12 = $28,800 per placement!
```

**Key Terms:**
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Bill Rate | What client pays us (hourly) |
| Pay Rate | What we pay the candidate (hourly) |
| Spread | Bill rate minus pay rate |
| Margin % | Spread ÷ Bill rate × 100 |
| GP (Gross Profit) | Total spread over time |

### US IT Market Basics

**Technology Categories:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Programming | Java, Python, .NET, JavaScript |
| Cloud | AWS, Azure, Google Cloud |
| Data | Data Engineer, Data Scientist, BI |
| DevOps | CI/CD, Kubernetes, Terraform |
| QA | Automation, Manual Testing |
| Security | Cybersecurity, SOC Analyst |
| Business | Business Analyst, Product Manager |

**Experience Levels:**
| Level | Years | Typical Rate ($/hr) |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| Junior | 0-2 | $40-55 |
| Mid | 3-5 | $55-75 |
| Senior | 5-8 | $70-95 |
| Lead/Architect | 8+ | $90-130+ |

### Work Authorization (Immigration)

**Types of Workers in US:**
| Status | Meaning | What to Know |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **US Citizen** | Born in US or naturalized | No restrictions |
| **Green Card (GC)** | Permanent resident | No restrictions, can work anywhere |
| **H1B** | Work visa | Tied to employer, needs sponsorship |
| **OPT** | Student work permit | Usually 1-3 years, limited time |
| **EAD** | Employment authorization | Can work anywhere, verify timeline |
| **TN Visa** | Canadian/Mexican workers | NAFTA visa, renewable |

**Important Rules:**
- H1B workers need sponsor company
- OPT has time limits (check carefully)
- Always verify current status
- Don't discriminate, but do verify

### Employment Types

| Type | Meaning | Who Pays? |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **W2** | Employee of our company | We handle taxes and benefits |
| **C2C** | Corp-to-Corp | Their company bills our company |
| **1099** | Independent contractor | They handle own taxes |

**Rate Conversions (Approximate):**
```
C2C rate is usually 10-15% higher than W2
Because C2C pays their own taxes/benefits

Example:
W2 rate: $60/hr
C2C rate: $66-69/hr (same take-home)
```
