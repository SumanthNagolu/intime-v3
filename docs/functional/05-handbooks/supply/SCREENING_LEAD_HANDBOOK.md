# Screening Lead Handbook

*The complete guide to sourcing, qualifying, and building the talent pipeline.*

---

## Part 1: Role Overview

### Your Mission

**Build a continuous pipeline of qualified candidates for our bench and client requirements.**

You own the talent sourcing engine:
- Source candidates from multiple channels
- Screen and qualify for skills and fit
- Feed qualified talent to Training and Bench teams
- Build relationships with OPT/CPT students and experienced professionals

**Pipeline is everything:** Without candidates, there are no placements.

### Key Responsibilities

| Area | What You Own |
|------|--------------|
| **Sourcing** | Find candidates from all channels |
| **Screening** | Qualify skills, visa, availability |
| **Pipeline** | Maintain healthy candidate database |
| **Training Referrals** | Send training-fit candidates to Training |
| **Bench Pipeline** | Send placement-ready to Bench/Recruiting |
| **Team Management** | Lead OPT recruiter and recruiters |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| New candidates sourced | 100+/week | Weekly |
| Qualified candidates | 25+/week | Weekly |
| Training referrals | 10+/month | Monthly |
| Placement-ready | 15+/month | Monthly |
| Pipeline health | 200+ active candidates | Always |
| Response rate | 15%+ from outreach | Weekly |

### Compensation Structure

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Base salary | ₹75,000-1,00,000/month |
| Per training enrollment | ₹3,000 |
| Per placement | ₹5,000 |
| Pipeline bonus | Quarterly based on metrics |
| Target total | ₹1,00,000-1,50,000/month |

## Part 2: Understanding Sourcing

### Candidate Sources

| Source | Type | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| Job boards | Dice, Indeed, Monster | Experienced candidates |
| LinkedIn | Direct outreach | Passive candidates |
| OPT databases | Schools, OPT portals | New graduates |
| Referrals | Current candidates | High quality |
| Training graduates | Internal | Pre-vetted talent |
| Inbound | Website, job postings | Active job seekers |

### Candidate Journey

```
Source → Contact → Screen → Qualify → Route
   │        │         │         │        │
   └────────┴─────────┴─────────┴────────┘
            SCREENING LEAD OWNS THIS FLOW
```

**Routing Logic:**
- Needs training → Training team
- Placement-ready → Bench/Recruiting
- Not a fit → Database for later

### Candidate Segments

| Segment | Profile | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| OPT/CPT | New grads, limited experience | Training candidates |
| Junior | 1-3 years | Training or entry-level roles |
| Mid-level | 3-6 years | Direct placement |
| Senior | 6+ years | Premium placements |
| On bench | Currently available | Fast-track to clients |
