### LinkedIn Sourcing Process

**Step 1: Search Setup**
```
Example Boolean for Java Developer:
"Java" AND ("Spring Boot" OR "Microservices") AND ("AWS" OR "Azure")
NOT recruiter NOT HR NOT manager

Filters:
- Location: United States
- Connections: 2nd and 3rd
- Current company: [exclude competitors]
```

**Step 2: Profile Review (30 seconds max)**
- Check current title and company
- Scan work history for relevance
- Look at skills and endorsements
- Note location and activity level

**Step 3: Reach Out**
- Personalize the message
- Reference something specific
- Keep it short
- Clear call to action

### LinkedIn Message Templates

be a great fit. It's a [role] with [client type] working on
[project]. The rate is [range] and it's [remote/location].

Does that sound interesting?

[If yes] Great. Let me tell you more about it and see if you'd
like to be submitted."

[If no immediate match:]
"I don't have anything that's a perfect fit right now, but your
background is strong and I know we'll have opportunities.

I'm going to add you to our qualified pool. When something comes
up that matches, I'll reach out.

In the meantime, keep me posted if anything changes with your

Let me share the details:

Position: [Title]
Rate: $[X]/hr
Start date: [Date]
Duration: [Length]
Location: [Remote/onsite]

[Share any other relevant details]

How does that sound to you?"

[If they accept:]
"Excellent! I'm thrilled. Here's what happens next..."

[If they want to negotiate:]
"I understand. What were you hoping for?"
[Listen, then] "Let me go back to them and see what's possible."

[If they decline:]
"I understand. Can you share what's making you hesitate?
Is there anything that would change your mind?"
```

### Handling Negotiation

```
"I hear you. You're looking for $[X]. Let me go back to them

If they can't move on rate, would you still be interested at

```

---

## Part 8: Objection Handling

### Common Candidate Objections

**"I'm not actively looking."**
```
"I understand. Most of the best candidates aren't actively
looking - that's exactly why I reached out.

I'm not asking you to make a decision today. But this role
has [specific appeal] which seemed relevant to your background.

Would you be open to a quick call to hear more? If it's not
a fit, no harm done."
```

**"The rate is too low."**
```
"I hear you. What rate would you need to be interested?

[Listen]

That's helpful to know. This particular role has a budget of
[X]. But I work on multiple opportunities - let me note your
expectations and reach out when something aligns better.

In the meantime, is there flexibility on your end if everything
else about an opportunity was perfect?"
```

**"I had a bad experience with recruiters."**
```
"I'm sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, not everyone in this
industry operates professionally.

I can tell you how we're different: [brief differentiator -
e.g., we don't submit without your permission, we prep you
thoroughly, we stay in touch throughout].

Give me a chance to earn your trust. If I don't deliver, you
can write me off too."
```

**"I'm already working with other recruiters."**
```
"That makes sense - most people are. I'm not asking for
exclusivity.

What I can offer is: [specific value - e.g., we specialize in
this exact skill, we have relationships with companies others
don't, we prep candidates better than anyone].

Can I at least show you this specific opportunity? If it's not
better than what you're seeing, no problem."
```

**"I need to think about it."**
```
"Of course, take your time. Can I ask what specifically you
want to think about?

[Listen]

[Address their concern if possible]

When would be a good time for me to follow up? I want to respect
your time while making sure you don't miss the window on this
opportunity."
```

**"I'm waiting on another offer."**
```
"Got it. That's exciting - sounds like things are moving for you.

Can I ask about the timeline? When do you expect to hear back?

If that offer comes through and is what you want, that's great.
But things can change. Would you be open to at least interviewing
for this role as a backup?

That way you have options, and you can make the best decision
when the time comes."
```

### Client/Vendor Objections

**"We need someone more senior."**
```
"Can you tell me more specifically what's missing?

[Listen]

I want to make sure I understand your needs. Is it years of
experience, or specific technical depth?

[If appropriate:] I have another candidate who might be a
better fit - would you be open to seeing them?"
```

**"The rate is too high."**
```
"I understand budget is a factor. This candidate's rate
reflects their [specific value - e.g., rare skill, no ramp
time, proven track record].

Is there any flexibility on your end? If not, I can look for
other candidates, but there may be tradeoffs in experience.

What's the maximum budget you could consider for the right
candidate?"
```

**"We're moving forward with other candidates."**
```
"Thanks for letting me know. Can I ask what made them a
stronger fit?

[Listen - use this feedback]

If things don't work out with them, please keep [candidate]
in mind. And I'd love feedback on how I can better match
candidates to your needs going forward."
```

## Part 12: FAQ

**Q: How do I handle candidates who ghost?**
A: Follow up 3 times (different channels if possible), then move on. Note in their profile. Don't take it personally.

**Q: What if a candidate lies about their skills?**
A: Better qualification questions catch this. If discovered later, have honest conversation. Remove from pool if pattern continues.

**Q: How do I balance quantity vs quality?**
A: Quality first, always. One great submission beats five weak ones. But you still need volume - work on efficiency.

**Q: What if I can't find candidates for a requirement?**
A: Broaden search parameters, try different sources, ask team for help, communicate challenge to Team Lead. Don't stay silent.

**Q: How do I deal with low response rates?**
A: Test different messages, times, and channels. Personalize more. Ask Team Lead to review your approach.
