# Bench Sales Handbook

*The complete guide to marketing and placing consultants.*

---

## Part 1: Role Overview

### Your Mission

**Keep our consultants working by proactively selling them to clients and vendors.**

You are the revenue engine for our bench consultants. When someone is on bench (available), you:
- Market them aggressively to vendors and clients
- Respond to requirements that match their skills
- Negotiate rates and terms
- Close deals and get them placed

**Time is money:** Every day a consultant is on bench, we're paying salary without billing. Your job is to minimize that time.

### Key Responsibilities

| Area | What You Own |
|------|--------------|
| **Marketing** | Create and send hotlists, profiles |
| **Prospecting** | Find new vendors and clients |
| **Requirement Response** | Match bench consultants to open jobs |
| **Submission** | Submit and follow up on candidates |
| **Negotiation** | Handle rate discussions |
| **Closing** | Get offers and acceptances |
| **Relationship Building** | Maintain vendor/client relationships |

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Marketing touches | 15+/day per consultant | Daily |
| Requirements responded | 20+/week | Weekly |
| Submissions | 10+/week | Weekly |
| Interviews | 5+/week | Weekly |
| Placements | 2-3/month | Monthly |
| Bench days average | <30 days | Monthly |
| Bench utilization | 90%+ | Monthly |

### Compensation Structure

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Base salary | ₹28,000-40,000/month |
| Per placement bonus | ₹8,000-15,000 |
| Margin share | 15-20% of gross profit |
| Target total | ₹50,000-80,000/month |

---

## Part 2: Understanding Bench

### What is Bench?

**Bench = Consultants on our payroll who aren't currently billing**

They could be:
- New hires waiting for first placement
- Consultants between assignments
- Consultants whose projects ended

**The Cost:**
```
Consultant on bench at $50/hr salary:
Daily cost: $50 × 8 = $400
Weekly cost: $400 × 5 = $2,000
Monthly cost: $2,000 × 4 = $8,000

Every month on bench = $8,000 lost!
```

### Bench Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Bench Size | Number of consultants available | Minimize |
| Bench Days | Average days from available to placed | <30 |
| Utilization | Billed hours ÷ Total hours | 90%+ |
| Placement Rate | % placed within 30 days | 80%+ |

### Bench Priority

**When someone goes on bench:**
1. Day 1-7: Urgent priority (heavy marketing)
2. Day 8-14: High priority (daily follow-ups)
3. Day 15-21: Critical (escalate, explore options)
4. Day 22+: Emergency (all hands, consider alternatives)

---

## Part 7: Negotiation & Closing

### Rate Negotiation

**Know Your Numbers:**
```
Our target margin: 15-20%

If consultant costs $50/hr:
Minimum bill rate: $50 ÷ 0.85 = $59/hr
Target bill rate: $50 ÷ 0.80 = $63/hr
```

**Negotiation Principles:**
- Know your floor (don't go below)
- Know their ceiling (what's their max?)
- Start higher, have room to move
- Trade, don't just give
- Get something for giving something

**Rate Negotiation Script:**
```
Vendor: "Can you do $55/hr?"

You: "The consultant's expectation is $60/hr. Given their
[X years experience / specific skills / immediate availability],
I think that's fair for this market.

Is there any flexibility on your end? If you can meet us at
$58, I can work with the consultant to accept."

[If they can't move]
"I understand budget constraints. Let me talk to the consultant
and see if there's any flexibility. But I want to set
expectations - $55 is significantly below market for this skill."
```

### Closing the Deal

**When Offer Comes:**

1. **Get Details:**
   - Rate confirmed
   - Start date
   - Duration
   - Location/remote
   - Any conditions

2. **Present to Consultant:**
   ```
   "[Name], great news! [Company] wants to move forward.

   Rate: $[X]/hr
   Start: [Date]
   Duration: [Length]

   How does that sound?"
   ```

3. **Handle Concerns:**
   - Address objections
   - Negotiate if needed
   - Don't pressure

4. **Secure Acceptance:**
   - Get verbal yes
   - Confirm in writing
   - Handle paperwork

**Consultant Acceptance Email:**
```
Subject: Offer Acceptance - [Company/Role]

Hi [Name],

Great news! I've accepted the offer for [Role] at [Company].

Confirmed details:
• Rate: $[X]/hr
• Start Date: [Date]
• Duration: [Length]
• Location: [Details]

Next steps:
• [Background check / paperwork / etc.]
• [First day logistics]

I'll send onboarding details separately.

Congratulations!

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Handling Counter-Offers

**If Consultant Wants Higher Rate:**
```
"I understand you're looking for $65. Let me go back to the
vendor and see if there's room.

Before I do - if they can't move on rate, what would make you
still say yes? Is there anything else that would help?"

[Go back to vendor]

"The consultant is very interested but was hoping for $65.
Is there any flexibility? They're willing to [start immediately /
sign longer contract / etc.] in exchange."
```

### Scenario: Consultant Picky About Roles

**Situation:** Consultant rejects opportunities for minor reasons.

**Response:**
```
"[Name], I understand you have preferences, and I want to find
you the right fit. But I need to share some context.

While you're on bench, the company is paying your salary without
billing revenue. We need to get you placed quickly.

This opportunity has [these positives]. What specifically is
making you hesitant?

[Listen]

Let me see if [their concern] can be addressed. But I need you
to be realistic - we may not find a perfect match immediately."
```

### Scenario: Vendor Wants Lower Rate

**Situation:** Vendor offers below your floor.

**Response:**
```
"I appreciate the offer, but $45/hr is significantly below
market for [skill] with this experience level.

Our floor is $55/hr. If you can meet us there, I can confirm
the consultant immediately.

Is there any flexibility, or should I keep them available for
other opportunities?"
```

### Scenario: Consultant Gets Multiple Offers

**Situation:** Consultant has offers from two sources.

**Response:**
```
"That's great! Let's compare them:

[Compare: rate, duration, project, location, company]

My recommendation would be [option] because [reasons].

But ultimately it's your decision. What matters most to you?

[Help them decide, but don't pressure]

Once you decide, we need to inform the other party professionally."
```

### Scenario: Interview Went Poorly

**Situation:** Consultant bombed the interview.

**Response:**
```
To Consultant:
"I heard the interview didn't go as well as we hoped. What

Let's schedule some prep time before your next interview."

To Vendor:
"Thank you for the feedback. I've discussed with [consultant]
and we're working on [their weak area].

I have another candidate who might be stronger for this -
would you be open to seeing them?"
