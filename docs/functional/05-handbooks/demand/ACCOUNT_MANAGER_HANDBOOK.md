## Part 2: Understanding Your Role

### Account Manager vs. Recruiter

**You work together:** Recruiters find candidates, you present them and close.

### Client Relationship Lifecycle

```

**Goal:** Move every client from Active to Strategic.

### Account Tiering

| Strategic | 10+ placements/year, growing | Weekly touch |
| Active | 3-10 placements/year, stable | Bi-weekly touch |
