## Part 10: Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Competitor Already In

**Situation:** They have existing staffing vendors.

**Response:**
```
"That's great you have partners you trust. Most of our clients
work with multiple vendors - it helps with coverage and keeps
everyone competitive.

What we often hear is that existing vendors struggle with
[specialized skills/speed/quality]. Is that your experience?

Even if everything's working well, having a backup option
makes sense. Can I send you a couple profiles to keep on file?"
```

### Scenario: Decision Takes Too Long

**Situation:** Proposal sent weeks ago, no decision.

**Response:**
```
"[Name], I wanted to check in on our proposal from [date].

I understand these decisions take time. Is there anything
blocking progress on your end?

If timing isn't right now, I'd rather know so I can plan
accordingly. What's your honest assessment?"
```

### Scenario: Lost to Competitor

**Situation:** They chose another vendor.

**Response:**
```
"Thanks for letting me know. I appreciate your transparency.

If you don't mind sharing - what made you choose them over us?
I want to make sure I'm presenting our value clearly.

Also, if things don't work out or you need additional support
in the future, please keep us in mind. I'll check in
periodically if that's okay."
```
