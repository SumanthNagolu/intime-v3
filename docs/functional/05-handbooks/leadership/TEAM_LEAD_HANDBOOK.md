# India Team Lead Handbook

*The complete guide to leading InTime's India recruiting operations.*

---

## Part 1: Role Overview

### Your Mission

**Build and lead a high-performing recruiting team that delivers quality placements consistently.**

You are the founder's right hand in India. You are responsible for:
- Day-to-day operations of the India team
- Training and developing team members
- Quality control on all work
- Hitting team metrics and targets
- Building the culture

### Why This Role Matters

The Team Lead is the **most critical hire** in our India operations. You set the standard. Your work ethic becomes the team's work ethic. Your quality bar becomes the team's quality bar. Your attitude becomes the team's attitude.

If you succeed, the entire India operation succeeds. If you fail, everything fails.
