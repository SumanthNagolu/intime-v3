## Team Structure

### Hiring Philosophy: Senior Leads + Intern Pipeline

**Core Principle**: Each pod has ONE senior experienced hire who leads and trains interns. Interns become your recruiters, coordinators, and account managers over 3 months.

**Why This Works**:
- Dramatically lower costs (interns at ₹15-25K vs ₹50-75K for experienced)
- Build loyalty — you trained them, they stay
- Senior leads are accountable for pod outcomes
- After 3 months, interns are productive AND you can hire more seniors if needed

### Total Headcount: 16
