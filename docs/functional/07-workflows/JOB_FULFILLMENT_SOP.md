### PHASE 2: CANDIDATE MATCHING AND SOURCING STRATEGY

**Step 2.1: Define Matching Criteria**

Document the matching matrix:

```
MATCHING CRITERIA MATRIX

TIER 1 - MUST-HAVE (Hard Requirements):
1. _________________
2. _________________
3. _________________
(Cannot proceed without these)

TIER 2 - SHOULD-HAVE (Strong Preference):
1. _________________
2. _________________
3. _________________
(Should have at least 2 of 3)

TIER 3 - NICE-TO-HAVE (Differentiators):
1. _________________
2. _________________
(Good bonus, not required)

DISQUALIFIERS (Deal-Breakers):
1. _________________
2. _________________
(Auto-reject if present)
```

**Step 2.2: Implement Tiered Sourcing Strategy**

Follow this priority order - each tier completed in parallel if needed:

**TIER 1: BENCH SEARCH (0-2 days)**
- Query InTime bench database for candidates matching Tier 1 + Tier 2 criteria
- Filter for candidates "Ready to Work" or "Available Within 1 Week"
- Prioritize candidates previously placed or successfully interviewed
- Run quick phone screen (15 min) if candidate is marginal match
- If 2+ strong bench candidates found → proceed to PHASE 3 (Candidate Preparation)
- If 1 marginal or 0 candidates → proceed immediately to TIER 2

**TIER 2: ACTIVE POOL SOURCING (1-5 days)**
- Search recent applicants to open requisitions (past 30 days)
- LinkedIn recruiter search with matching filters
- Contact recent candidates who declined similar roles (ping message: "We have a new role that might be more aligned...")
- Coordinate with other recruiters in India ops for candidate recommendations
- If 1+ match found → proceed to PHASE 3
- If no match → proceed to TIER 3

**TIER 3: NEW SOURCING (2-10 days)**
- LinkedIn outbound recruiting (connection + InMail)
- Job board postings (LinkedIn Jobs, Dice, GitHub Jobs, specialized boards)
- Passive headhunting via employee referrals
- Third-party vendor engagement (if client budget allows)
- India ops deep-dive: run advanced sourcing from India team
- Attend virtual job fairs, networking events
- Expected yield: 20-30 outreach touches for 2-3 qualified candidates

**Activity Tracking:** Log all sourcing activities in ATS with timestamps. Report daily.

**Step 2.3: Candidate Screening Criteria**

Before submitting, candidates MUST pass:

| Criterion | Pass/Fail | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Must-Have Skills** | Pass | All required skills evident on resume and/or LinkedIn |
| **Years of Experience** | Pass | Meets or exceeds stated minimum |
| **Work Authorization** | Pass | Confirmed in phone screen; visa sponsorship question asked |
| **Availability** | Pass | Can start by target start date; notice period acceptable |
| **Phone Screen** | Pass | Professional demeanor; clear communication; engaged |
| **No Disqualifiers** | Pass | Confirmed no deal-breakers present |
| **Compensation Alignment** | Pass | Candidate's ask within client's range (or negotiable) |
| **Geographic/Travel Fit** | Pass | Can meet location requirements or relocation preferences |

Document all screening outcomes in ATS. Do not advance candidates who fail any "Pass/Fail" criterion.

### PHASE 7: OFFER NEGOTIATION

**Step 7.1: Prepare for Offer Stage**

- Pay rate to candidate (net of InTime margin)
- Start date
- Any signing bonus or other compensation
- Contract terms (if contract role)

**Step 7.2: Manage Candidate-Side Negotiation**

When client extends verbal offer, before candidate accepts:

**Candidate Negotiation Call (Account Manager + Recruiting Lead):**
Duration: 20-30 minutes

Script:

```
[Candidate Name],

Great news - [Client Name] would like to make you an offer for the [Role Title] position!

Here are the terms:
- Position: [Role Title] at [Client Name]
- Compensation: $[X] per hour / $[X] annually
- Start Date: [Date]
- Contract Duration: [If applicable]
- [Any other key terms: bonus, benefits, etc.]

Before we move forward, I want to make sure this feels right to you.

A few questions:
1. How does the compensation feel? [Listen; if low, see below for negotiation]
2. Is the start date workable for you?
3. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the role or company?
4. Are you fully committed to accepting if we confirm these terms?

[If candidate is hesitant on compensation:]
"I understand. What would make this more attractive to you?
[Listen for number]
Let me go back to [Client Name] and see if there's flexibility here.
I'll call you back within [2-4 hours]."

[If candidate is thrilled:]
"Perfect. I'll get this in writing from [Client Name], and we'll send you
a formal offer letter. I'll need you to sign and return it within [X] days.
We're targeting a start date of [Date]. Does that work?"
```

**Negotiation Boundaries:**
- Do not promise increases you haven't confirmed with client
- Do not pressure candidate to accept below their stated needs
- Frame negotiations positively: "I'll explore flexibility on that number with the client"

**Step 7.3: Manage Client-Side Negotiation**

If candidate counters on rate or start date:

Call/email client:

```
[Client Name],

[Candidate Name] is very interested in the [Role Title] position and
appreciates the offer. They've asked about [Specific negotiation point]:

Current offer: $[X]
Candidate's ask: $[X]

Given their [Specific strength - years of experience, rare skill, strong interview],
would you have flexibility to move to $[X+Y]? This would bring them more aligned
with market rate for this skill set and secure a strong hire.

Alternatively, if the rate is fixed, could we discuss [Other negotiation point:
signing bonus, contract extension, flexible start date]?

Let me know what works best, and I'll circle back with [Candidate Name] immediately.
```

**Negotiation Strategy:**
- For P0 (urgent) roles: Push for client flexibility to close deal
- For P1/P2: More conservative; don't over-negotiate if candidate is good fit
- Target outcome: Close within 10% of original offer on either side

---

Request client send formal offer letter to candidate including:

- Contract duration (if applicable)
- Key terms (confidentiality, non-compete if applicable, benefits)
- Offer expiration date (typically 5-7 business days)

**Step 8.2: Candidate Acceptance**

Upon acceptance:
- Confirm verbal: "Congratulations! Welcome to the team!"
- Get written confirmation in email or signature
- Document acceptance date in ATS
- Mark job requisition as "Filled"

**Step 8.3: Handoff to Delivery Manager**

Notify Delivery Manager immediately with:
- Candidate name, contact info, start date

## 5. ESCALATION FOR HARD-TO-FILL ROLES

When a requisition exceeds 10 days without a placement, activate escalation protocol:

**Step 1: Escalation Meeting (Recruiting Lead + Account Manager)**
- Review requirement: Are we too restrictive? Prioritize Tier 1 (must-have) vs. Tier 2
- Check sourcing effectiveness: Have we tapped all channels?
- Assess market conditions: Is this a common skill set? Salary competitive?
- Decision: Adjust criteria, increase sourcing intensity, or engage external vendor

**Step 2: Expanded Sourcing (Recruiting Lead + India Ops)**
- Engage India recruiting center of excellence for passive candidate search
- Conduct recruiter networking: Internal referral blasts to all recruiters
- Activate external agency partnership (contract with premium recruiting firm)
- Host mini job fair: Reach out to recent candidates from competitor companies
- Adjust targeting: Expand geography, experience level, or skill set flexibility

**Step 3: Scope Negotiation with Client**
- Present findings: "We've conducted extensive sourcing. Here's what we're seeing in the market."
- Propose adjustments: "Are you open to candidates with [Slightly different skill]?" or "Would a relocation package help?"
- Adjust rate if needed: "Increasing the pay by $5/hour would significantly expand the candidate pool."
- Reset expectations: "Based on market demand, we're targeting 21-28 days for this profile."

**Step 4: Intensive Push**
- Daily submissions: Target 5-7 qualified candidates per week
- Multiple interview rounds: Get multiple candidates in client's interview pipeline
- Maintain momentum: Weekly client calls to ensure active evaluation

Subject: Update on [Client Name] - [Role Title] Opportunity

Hi [Candidate Name],

Thank you so much for your time interviewing with [Client Name] for the
[Role Title] position. We really appreciated your enthusiasm and the great
conversation you had with their team.

Unfortunately, they've decided to move forward with another candidate whose
background was a closer match for [Specific reason - if known]. This doesn't
reflect any shortcoming on your part - it's just the fit they were looking for
at this moment.

That said, your experience with [Key Skill] is impressive, and we'd love to
keep you in mind for future opportunities. Would it be helpful if I sent you
links to a couple of other roles we're working on that might be interesting?

In the meantime, if you'd like to explore other options, feel free to send me
your updated preferences, and I'll keep my eyes open.

All the best,
[Recruiter Name]

## 8. COMMON SCENARIOS AND DECISIONS

**Scenario 1: Candidate Gets Another Offer**
- Call candidate immediately and ask: "How does this compare to where we are with [Client Name]?"
- Contact client same day: "I have an amazing candidate who also has another offer pending. Can we expedite the interview to [Tomorrow]?"
- Negotiate with candidate: "Give me 24 hours to move this along. If the client can't match, let's discuss."

**Scenario 2: Client Suddenly Reduces Headcount**
- Call client immediately to confirm: "I want to make sure I understand - are you pausing this search or canceling?"
- If pausing: Agree on "hold" timeline (e.g., "revisit in 2 weeks")
- If pausing indefinitely: Formally close requisition; inform candidates; prepare contingency sourcing plans
- If canceling: Formally close; prepare client for possible penalties (if applicable to contract)

**Scenario 3: Candidate Declines Offer (After Accepting Verbally)**
- Call candidate immediately: "I heard you have some concerns - let's talk."
- Listen without judgment - there may be legitimate reasons (company research, other offer, timing)
- Ask: "What would change your decision?" (sometimes it's just compensation or start date)
- If unable to move candidate: Notify client immediately and back to sourcing; do not ghost client

**Scenario 4: Client Wants to Push Back Start Date**
- Confirm candidate's flexibility: "Can you stay available, or do you need to accept other options?"
- If candidate can wait: Email client "Confirmed - [Candidate] can start [New Date]"
- If candidate cannot wait: Negotiate with client or prepare for backfill candidate

**Scenario 5: Multiple Candidates, Multiple Clients (Priority Management)**
- P0 clients get priority matching and submission
- Never hold strong P2 candidate for P1 client longer than 24 hours (unless explicitly approved)
- Be transparent: "I have another client who wants to interview this candidate. Can we expedite your process?"

When sourcing from India recruiting center of excellence:

**Handoff Protocol:**
1. Share detailed requirement (Matching Criteria Matrix, must-haves, timeline)
2. Agree on expected candidate volume and quality level
3. Set daily check-in time (Asia working hours)
4. Define turnaround: How many candidates per day/week?
5. Quality gate: Recruiting Lead QA's all India-sourced resumes before submission to client

**Daily Standup (8:00 AM IST = 10:30 PM PT previous day):**
- Candidates sourced yesterday
- Candidate pipeline (in progress, screened, ready for submission)
- Blockers or questions
- Next day's targets
