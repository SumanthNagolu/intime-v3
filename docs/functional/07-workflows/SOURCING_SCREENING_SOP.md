have permanent placement roles available. What appeals to you more?"
```

**Objection: "Your rate is too low"**
```
RESPONSE: "I hear you. Can you help me understand where you arrived at that number?
Our range of $[X]-$[Y] is based on the market rate for [experience level] [role].
Are you open to a discussion about what makes sense for this specific opportunity?"
```

**Objection: "I need more details about the company before I commit"**
```
RESPONSE: "Absolutely, that's smart due diligence. I'm going to send you a detailed
job description and company overview. Take a look, and we can schedule a call with
the hiring manager so you can ask them directly. How does [day/time] work for you?"
```

**Objection: "I'm currently interviewing with [another company]"**
```
RESPONSE: "Good for you! Let's keep in touch then. What's your timeline for those
other opportunities? I want to make sure we move fast if this is a fit and you're
open to exploring it in parallel."
```
