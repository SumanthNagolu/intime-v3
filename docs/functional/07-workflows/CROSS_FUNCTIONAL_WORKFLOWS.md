**Supply Chain Conversion Metrics:**

| Stage | Goal | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Enrollment → Graduation | 80% | Some attrition (life happens) |
| Graduation → Pool Entry | 100% | All graduates enter pool |
| Pool → Interview | 60% | Competition from other candidates |
| Interview → Offer | 70% | Better conversion for academy grads |
| Offer → Acceptance | 95% | Academy creates alignment |
| Acceptance → Day 1 Success | 95% | Rare dropouts post-offer |
| Day 1 → 30-day success | 90% | Ramp-up takes time |
| Day 30 → 90-day success | 85% | Some may not be right fit |
| 90-day → Extension/Long-term | 70% | Client decides to extend or move on |

**Revenue from Academy:**

```
Training Revenue (Direct):
  - ₹1.5L × 20 students/month = ₹30L/month

Placement Revenue (Indirect):
  - 80% graduation × 20 = 16 graduates/month in pool
  - 60% placement rate = 10 placements/month from academy
  - Average placement: $30K/year = $2.5K/month × 10 = $25K/month

Total Academy Contribution: ₹30L + $25K ≈ ₹40-50L/month (with forex conversion)
```

            "I noticed [specific issue]. Let's talk about how I can help."
            Goal: Understand problem, offer support, agree on improvement plan

Day 3: Follow-up check-in with consultant
       ├─ Is situation improving?
       └─ If yes: Continue monitoring
            If no: Escalate to Ops Manager

Day 5: Ops Manager involved
       ├─ Conversation with Delivery Manager + Consultant (3-way call if needed)
       ├─ Formal performance plan: "Here's what needs to improve by [date]"
       ├─ Support: Mentoring, additional training, resources
       └─ Document: Notes in HR file

Day 12: Review performance plan
        ├─ Has consultant improved?
        └─ If yes: Continue (reduce monitoring frequency)
           If no: Escalate to CEO

Day 15: CEO meeting
        ├─ CEO meets with Consultant
        ├─ Final conversation: "This isn't working. What would help?"
        ├─ Options: Reassign to different client, PIP, or termination
        └─ Decision: Document and implement

Throughout: Account Manager kept updated
            ├─ Client may be aware of performance issues
