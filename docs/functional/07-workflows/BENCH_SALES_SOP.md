### Step 3: Candidate-to-Opportunity Matching (12:30 PM - 2:00 PM)

**Owner:** Bench Sales Reps (with Bench Lead review)

Matching is the critical step where we identify which consultant is the best fit for which opportunity.

#### Matching Criteria

**Technical Fit (Weight: 40%)**
- Does consultant have all must-have skills?
- Does experience level match? (Senior/Mid/Junior)
- Is there relevant industry experience?
- How strong is skill depth? (1-2 years vs. 8+ years)

**Location Fit (Weight: 20%)**
- Is consultant in required location or willing to relocate?
- Does consultant prefer remote/on-site/hybrid?
- Any relocation constraints?

**Rate Fit (Weight: 20%)**
- Is InTime's bill rate within client's budget?
- Does margin allow profitability?
- Is consultant's rate expectation achievable?
- Any negotiation room?

**Availability Fit (Weight: 10%)**
- When can consultant start?
- Does this match client's required start date?
- Any constraints (vacation, other commitments)?

**Client Preference (Weight: 10%)**
- Does client have specific background requirement? (e.g., prior experience with their tech stack)
- Is this a repeat client (higher likelihood to place)?
- Have we successfully placed with this client before?

#### Match Scoring

```
MATCH SCORE CALCULATION:

Technical Fit (1-10):
  10 = Perfect skill match, exact experience level
  7-9 = Strong match, all must-haves, slight experience gap
  5-6 = Good match, 1-2 nice-to-haves missing
  3-4 = Fair match, missing 1 must-have, but learnable
  1-2 = Poor match, missing multiple must-haves

Location Fit (1-10):
  10 = Perfect location match
  7-9 = Good match, willing to relocate or remote available
  5-6 = Acceptable, some relocation needed
  3-4 = Challenging, but possible
  1-2 = Not feasible

Rate Fit (1-10):
  10 = Perfect margin (20%+), within budget
  7-9 = Good margin (15-20%), within budget
  5-6 = Acceptable margin (10-15%), within budget
  3-4 = Tight margin (5-10%), at budget ceiling
  1-2 = Below margin or over budget

Availability (1-10):
  10 = Available to start immediately
  7-9 = Available within 1-2 weeks
  5-6 = Available within 3-4 weeks
  3-4 = Available within 5-6 weeks
  1-2 = Long delay or constraints

OVERALL SCORE = (Technical × 0.40) + (Location × 0.20) + (Rate × 0.20) + (Availability × 0.10) + (Client Preference × 0.10)

SCORE INTERPRETATION:
8-10 = PRIORITY SUBMIT - High likelihood of placement
6-7.9 = SUBMIT - Good fit, proceed with submission
5-5.9 = CONSIDER - Acceptable, but have better options or concerns
3-4.9 = BACKLOG - Keep for future, not immediate priority
1-2.9 = DO NOT SUBMIT - Poor fit, waste of time and credibility
```

#### Matching Decision Matrix

```
MATCH DECISION LOGIC:

IF Technical Score < 6:
  → DO NOT SUBMIT (incorrect skill set, credibility risk)

IF Location Score < 3 AND consultant not open to relocation:
  → DO NOT SUBMIT (logistics won't work)

IF Rate Score < 3 AND no negotiation room:
  → DO NOT SUBMIT (financial viability issue)

IF Availability Score < 2:
  → DEFER (wait for availability, then submit)

IF Overall Score >= 8:
  → PRIORITY SUBMIT TODAY (highest value use of time)

IF Overall Score 6-7.9:
  → SUBMIT THIS WEEK (good fit, queue for next submission batch)

IF Overall Score 5-5.9:
  → HOLD (keep for comparison, submit only if better option unavailable)
```

---

### Step 4: Consultant Profiling (Before Submission)

**Owner:** Bench Sales Rep

## Rate Negotiation

### Step 10: Negotiate Rate & Terms

**Owner:** Bench Lead + Bench Sales Rep

Rate negotiation happens after client expresses interest but before offer.

#### Rate Negotiation Framework

**BEFORE NEGOTIATION:**

Establish your parameters:

```
RATE PARAMETERS TEMPLATE

Consultant: [Name]
Cost to InTime (consultant rate): $[X]/hr
Market Rate (industry standard): $[Y]-$[Z]/hr
Target Bill Rate: $[A]/hr (X% markup)
Floor Bill Rate: $[B]/hr (minimum profit margin)
Walk-Away Rate: Below $[C]/hr (too low margin)

MARGIN ANALYSIS:
Target Bill Rate $[A]/hr
Less: Consultant Rate $[X]/hr
Less: Payroll Taxes & Benefits [15% of rate]
Less: Overhead Allocation [10% of rate]
= NET MARGIN: [X%]

Minimum Acceptable Margin: [10-15%]
Target Margin: [20%+]

POSITIONING STRATEGY:
[How do we position this rate to client? What's the value justification?]
```

#### During Negotiation

**Client Says:** "Your rate is too high. We were hoping for $[lower amount]."

**Your Response Options:**

**Option 1 (Defend the Rate):**
```
"I appreciate that feedback. Here's what makes this rate fair:
- [Consultant Name] brings [specific, valuable experience]
- They can [specific capability that saves client money/time]
- Market rate for [this skill level] is currently $[X]-$[Y]
- Our rate of $[Z] is actually competitive for someone of this caliber

Is there flexibility in your budget, or should we discuss what we could adjust?"
```

**Option 2 (Explore Flexibility):**
```
"I understand budget is important. Let's talk through this:
- What was your target rate?
- Is that flexible at all?
- Would a slightly lower rate work if we extended the contract length?
- Are there other terms (exclusive contract, longer duration) that could work?"
```

**Option 3 (Create Value):**
```
"Rather than dropping rate, what if we structure this differently?
- Lower rate for first month, then market rate after probation?
- Discount for 6+ month contract commitment?
- Reduced rate but 40 hours/week guaranteed (vs. hourly variable)?
- Performance bonus if they hit specific project milestones?"
```

#### Rate Negotiation Decision Tree

```
CLIENT RATE PROPOSAL vs. FLOOR RATE:

IF Client Rate >= Target Bill Rate:
  → ACCEPT IMMEDIATELY
     "That works perfectly. Let's move forward!"

IF Target Bill Rate > Client Rate >= Floor Bill Rate:
  → ATTEMPT NEGOTIATION
     Explain value, ask if flexible, explore alternatives
     IF Client won't budge:
       → Present to Bench Lead for approval
       → Accept if margins acceptable

IF Client Rate < Floor Bill Rate:
  → REQUEST HIGHER RATE
     Explain floor is minimum for profitability
     IF Client insists:
       → DECLINE OFFER (preserve margins, reputation)
       "Unfortunately, we can't make that work financially. Let me send you another candidate who might fit your budget."

IF Client Rate SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW Floor (e.g., 30%+ below):
  → DO NOT COUNTER
     Risk: Looks desperate, loses negotiating credibility
     Response: "I appreciate the offer, but that's below what we need for this arrangement."
```

#### Rate Negotiation Email Template

```
Subject: Rate Discussion - [Consultant Name] for [Job Title]

Hi [Hiring Manager Name],

Thanks for your interest in [Consultant Name]. I wanted to circle back on the rate discussion.

Our proposed rate of $[X]/hr reflects:
- [Consultant Name]'s [specific experience/skill value]
- Current market rates for this skill set: $[Y]-$[Z]/hr
- InTime's standard markup for staffing

I understand budget is important. Here are options:

OPTION 1: Accept our standard rate of $[X]/hr
OPTION 2: We could do $[slightly lower]/hr if you commit to 6+ months
