**Step 7.2: Problem Resolution Process**

**Step 1: Identify and Document Issue**

When problem identified:

**Step 3: Analysis and Root Cause**

Before intervening, understand the root cause:

- Is this a fit issue? (Consultant/client incompatibility)
- Is this a miscommunication? (Clarification needed)
- Is this a behavior/attitude issue? (Performance improvement plan needed)
- Is this a circumstance? (Personal issue affecting work)

**Step 4: Intervention and Action Plan**

**If Skills Gap:**
- Identify specific skill or knowledge gap
- Create a learning plan: "You need to develop [skill] by [date]"
- Assign mentor or training resource
- Schedule weekly check-in to monitor progress
- Success metric: "By [date], we expect you to independently [specific task]"

**If Fit Issue:**
- Have honest conversation: "I want to make sure this is a good fit for both sides. How are you feeling?"
- Explore options: Stay and adjust, or discuss transition
- If staying: Create specific behavioral expectations
- If transitioning: Initiate offboarding

**If Miscommunication:**
- Facilitate conversation between consultant and manager
- Clarify expectations: "Here's what we need from you..."

- Weekly check-in to ensure understanding

**If Behavior/Attitude Issue:**

2. Ask: "Is this immediate, or do we have time to improve?" (Usually they give 1-2 weeks)
3. Call consultant; explain situation objectively
4. Determine: Can this be fixed, or is transition the best option?
5. If transition: Initiate offboarding immediately
6. If recovery possible: Create intensive action plan with daily check-ins
7. Be realistic: Sometimes the fit just isn't there

### PHASE 8: RENEWAL AND EXTENSION CONVERSATIONS

**Step 8.1: Identify Renewal Candidates Early**

For contract roles, begin renewal planning 60-90 days before expiration:

**Renewal Timeline:**
- **Day 90 (Contract 180+ days out):** Gauge initial interest; "Any thoughts on extending?"
- **Day 120:** Formal renewal conversation; present options
- **Day 150:** Confirm decision with both consultant and client
- **Day 165:** Execute renewal agreement or begin transition planning

**Step 8.2: Renewal Conversation with Client**

Timing: 60-90 days before contract end date

```
CLIENT RENEWAL CONVERSATION

Hi [Client Contact],

As we think about [Consultant Name]'s contract expiring [Date], I wanted to
touch base about your plans moving forward.

A few questions:
1. Is [Consultant Name] a fit you want to continue with?
2. Are you expecting to need the same capacity/role for the next [period]?
3. Would you consider converting this to permanent? Are they someone you'd hire?
4. What's your timeline for the renewal decision?

[Listen to response; gauge enthusiasm]

IF POSITIVE (want to continue):
"Great. Based on [market data / rate adjustments / new scope], here's what I'm
thinking for the renewal rate: [Rate]. Does that work for your budget?

Let me also check with [Consultant Name] on their end and we'll come back with
a formal renewal agreement by [Date]."

IF NEUTRAL (maybe, depends on):
"Understood. What are the factors that would make you want to extend?
[Listen] Okay, let me check in with [Consultant] about those things and come
back to you with a plan."

IF NEGATIVE (want to end):
"I understand. What's your timeline? [Listen] Okay, so we'll plan on wrapping
up [Date]. That gives [Consultant] time to transition knowledge and plan next.

Is there anything we can do to change your mind, or is the decision final?"
```

**Step 8.3: Renewal Conversation with Consultant**

Timing: Similar to client conversation (60-90 days before expiration)

```
CONSULTANT RENEWAL CONVERSATION

Hi [Consultant Name],

As we're approaching [Date] when your contract expires, I wanted to touch base
on your plans moving forward.

First, how have you been enjoying working at [Client Name]?

[Listen to feedback]

Here's what I'm hearing from [Client Name]: [Client's sentiment - positive/neutral/etc.].

A few things to explore:
1. Would you want to continue at [Client Name] if they wanted to extend?
2. Are you open to a longer-term engagement, or were you looking to move to
   something new?
3. Is the role and compensation still feeling right?

[Listen to responses]

My thinking: [Client Name] is [open/considering/not interested] in extending.
On your end, [you're interested / you're exploring other options / etc.].

Let me confirm with [Client Name] on their plans, and we'll figure out the best
path forward. Either way, I want to make sure you're set up for success next,
whether that's continuing or transitioning to your next opportunity.

What questions do you have?
```

**Step 8.4: Execute Renewal Agreement or Plan Transition**

**If Renewing:**

Create renewal agreement with:
- New rate (with any increases negotiated)
- New contract duration (typically 6-12 months)
- Any changed scope or responsibilities
- Same or updated terms

Send to consultant and client for signature; file in deal documentation.

**If Not Renewing / Transitioning:**

Initiate offboarding process (see Phase 9).

**Common Issues:**
- Consultant didn't submit on time (rush to get in before Friday deadline)
- Hours don't match expected schedule (investigate why)
- Client didn't sign off (follow up with manager)
- Discrepancies between submitted hours and project time tracking

**Step 2: Address Timesheet Issues Immediately**

If consultant routinely submits late or inaccurately:
- Direct conversation: "I noticed your timesheets have been [issue]. This needs to be on time and accurate every week."
- Clarify expectations: "Timesheets due by [Day], signed off by [Date]."
- Set corrective action: "Starting next week, I need to see improvement."
- Monitor closely: Check in weekly for 4 weeks

If pattern continues:
- Escalate to Account Manager
- Issue formal warning to consultant
- Flag as compliance risk in ATS
- Consider impact on future engagements
