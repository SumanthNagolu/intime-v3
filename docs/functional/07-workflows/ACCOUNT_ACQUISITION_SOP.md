**Step 2.2: LinkedIn Connection Outreach**

**Approach:**
- Create profile: Professional headshot, InTime branding, "Staffing Specialist at InTime"
- Personalize connection requests: Don't use default message; reference specific detail about prospect

**Connection Message Template:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I came across your profile and your work leading the engineering team at [Company]
looks impressive - particularly your focus on [Specific initiative or tech].

I work with InTime (IT staffing firm), and we partner with growth-stage tech
companies to rapidly scale their engineering teams with contract and permanent hires.

Given [Company]'s expansion in [Specific tech/market], we've worked with similar
companies in [Industry] to source [Specific role: Senior Python engineers / DevOps
engineers / etc.] quickly without the long hiring cycle.

If it makes sense, would be great to grab 15 minutes to discuss if there's ever
a fit. No pressure either way.

[Your Name]
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- 50% connection acceptance rate
- 15-25% responses to outreach (of those who accept)
- Move ~3-5% of connections to first call

**Step 2.3: Email Outreach (Cold Email Campaign)**

**Structure: 3-Touch Email Sequence**

**TOUCH 1: Initial Outreach (Day 1)**

Subject: "[Company] - Fastest Way to Hire Senior [Role Type]"

Body:

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] has been actively hiring on LinkedIn, particularly for
[Specific role or department].

Most companies we work with tell us the same thing: "Finding qualified
[Technical Role] takes 3-6 months and our internal team is swamped."

InTime helps mid-market tech companies like [Company] close open [Role Type]
positions in 14-21 days - whether it's permanent placements or contract
engineering support.

Here's what makes us different:
• Direct access to our bench of 200+ pre-screened [Skill] engineers
• No long job order process - we source within 24-48 hours
• Success-based fees (you only pay if the hire works out)

Would be worth a quick 15-minute call to discuss if we have someone who fits
your current needs?

Looking forward,

[Your Name]
[Title]
[Company]
[Phone]
[Email]
```

**TOUCH 2: Soft Follow-up (Day 7)**

Subject: "Re: [Company] - Fastest Way to Hire Senior [Role Type]"

Body:

```
Hi [First Name],

Wanted to follow up on my email from last week about InTime's staffing solutions.

I understand if you're not actively hiring at the moment - but in case you are
looking to fill [Specific role opening you noticed], would be great to connect.

We've worked with [Similar Company] and [Similar Company 2] in this space and
consistently help them hire 30% faster than their internal team.

Feel free to reach out if helpful.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**TOUCH 3: Warm Hand-Off (Day 14-21)**

Subject: "One More Thing - [Company]'s Open [Role Type] Opportunity"

Body:

```
Hi [First Name],

This will be my last email on this - promise! 😊

I know you're busy, but I came across the open [Specific Role Title] position
on your careers page and wanted to reach out one last time.

If your team is actively recruiting for that role, I'd love to be a resource.
We just placed a similar profile at [Relevant Company] in 18 days.

If not now, feel free to save my contact info for when you do need staffing support.

All the best,
[Your Name]
[Phone]
```

**Email List Management:**
- Track opens and clicks (use email tracking tool like Outlook tracking or HubSpot)
- Remove non-openers after Touch 3; keep in passive list for 6 months
- Segment list by response (positive, neutral, no response) for call strategy

**Step 2.4: Phone Outreach (Warm Calls)**

If you have a phone number and the prospect has not responded to email/LinkedIn:

**Cold Call Script:**

```
[Dial prospect]

[Prospect answers]: "Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from InTime. Do you
have 30 seconds? I know this is out of the blue."

[Wait for response]

"Great - the reason I'm calling is I was looking at [Company]'s open positions
for [Role Type], and I know from talking to similar companies that hiring for
those roles can be brutally slow.

We work with mid-market tech companies to source and place engineering talent
in 2-3 weeks. I've had some success helping companies like [Similar Company]
move faster on [Specific Role Type] hiring.

Would it make sense to grab 15 minutes next week to see if we have someone
who fits? No pressure if the timing's not right."

[If positive]: "Perfect. Let me send you a calendar invite for [Day/Time].
What's the best email for that?"

[If negative]: "Totally understand - I'm sure you're busy. Do you mind if I
reach out again in a few months if anything changes?"

[If unsure]: "I get it. Here's what I'll do - I'm going to send you a quick
one-pager on what we do. If something comes up with your hiring, reach out.
Sound good?"
```

**Call Effectiveness:**
- Expected connection rate: 20-30% (many go to voicemail)
- Of those reached: 30-40% agree to brief conversation
- Of brief conversations: 10-20% move to full discovery call

---

### PHASE 3: DISCOVERY CALL AND QUALIFICATION

**Step 3.1: Schedule Discovery Call**

Once prospect agrees to call (via email, LinkedIn, or phone):

Email confirmation:

```
Perfect. I've sent you a calendar invite for [Day, Time, Timezone].

I'll call you at [Your Phone #] at [Time]. The call will be about 20-30 minutes.
Just to set expectations, I'll be asking some questions about your team's
hiring plans and challenges - this will help me understand if there's a fit.

Looking forward to connecting.
```

**Discovery Call Details:**
- Duration: 25-30 minutes
- Timing: Early in week (Mon-Wed), mid-morning or early afternoon (avoid Friday)
- Format: Phone or Zoom (ask prospect preference)
- Participants: BDM + possibly sales manager/founder (if warm introduction or strategic account)

**Step 3.2: Conduct BANT + Staffing Qualification**

**BANT Framework** (standard B2B sales qualification):

| Criteria | What to Uncover | Sample Questions |
|---|---|---|
| **Budget** | Do they have funding/budget for staffing? | "How does your team budget for contractor/staffing costs?" "What's the typical cost per hire for your open roles?" |
| **Authority** | Is this person a decision-maker or do we need others? | "Are you the one who approves vendor selection, or is there a procurement process?" "Who else should I be talking to about staffing?" |
| **Need** | Do they have actual hiring need (not theoretical)? | "What are your top 3 hiring priorities right now?" "How many open positions do you have?" "What's the timeline?" |
| **Timeline** | When would they hire and by when? | "When are you looking to fill these roles?" "What's your ideal start date?" |

**Additional Staffing-Specific Questions:**

| Topic | Sample Questions |
|---|---|
| **Current Hiring Process** | "Walk me through how you currently hire for [Role Type]. What's working? What's frustrating?" "What's your typical time-to-fill?" |
| **Contractor/Flexible Staffing Use** | "Have you used contract or temp labor before?" "Any experience with staffing agencies?" "What was that experience like?" |
| **Hiring Challenges** | "What's been your biggest challenge filling [Role Type]?" "What gaps do you see in candidates you're interviewing?" |
| **Specific Open Roles** | "Tell me about your open roles. What are you looking to fill?" "How many [Role Type] engineers do you need?" "What's the timeline?" |
| **Volume & Frequency** | "How many engineers do you typically hire per year?" "Is this a one-time need or ongoing?" |
| **Rate/Budget** | "What's your budget for this role?" "Are we talking contract or permanent hire?" |
| **Internal vs. External** | "Do you have internal recruiters, or do you outsource?" "Would you be open to working with an external staffing partner?" |
| **Vendor Management** | "Do you have preferred vendors, or would you add a new partner?" "What's your vendor registration process?" |

**Qualification Decision Matrix:**

| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Need** (Active Hiring) | 1-3 | 3 = Actively hiring now; 2 = Planning in 1-3 months; 1 = Exploratory/future |
| **Authority** | 1-3 | 3 = Direct decision-maker; 2 = Recommender + approver; 1 = Influencer only |
| **Budget** | 1-3 | 3 = Budget confirmed, approved; 2 = Budget likely, pending approval; 1 = Budget unclear |
| **Timeline** | 1-3 | 3 = Hire within 30 days; 2 = Hire within 60 days; 1 = Hire 90+ days out or unknown |
| **Openness to Staffing** | 1-3 | 3 = Enthusiastic; 2 = Open; 1 = Skeptical or entrenched with competitor |

**Total Qualification Score:**
- 13-15: **Qualified (SAL)** - Sales Accepted Lead, move to proposal
- 10-12: **Nurture** - Stay in contact; monthly check-in; low priority
- <10: **Unqualified** - Polite exit; save for future; minimal follow-up

**Step 3.3: Closing the Discovery Call**

If qualified (Score 13+):

```
"Thanks so much for taking the time to walk me through this. It sounds like
you have [X] open [Role Type] positions, and you're looking to fill by [Date].

Here's what I'm thinking: I'm going to put together a quick overview of how
we work - our fee structure, timeline, bench, that sort of thing. I'll send
that to you by [Day]. Then we can schedule a brief follow-up to discuss next
steps. Does that work?"

[Wait for confirmation]

"Perfect. I'll get that over to you. In the meantime, if you think of any
specific candidates you're already interviewing or any other details about
the role, just shoot me a note. That'll help me make sure we're aligned."
```

If unqualified:

```
"Thanks so much for walking me through this. I really appreciate your time.

It sounds like you're not actively hiring right now, but [specific hiring
trigger], so I imagine staffing will become more relevant then.

Mind if I touch base in [3-6 months] to see how things are progressing?
In the meantime, if anything changes, you know where to find me."
```

---

### PHASE 4: PROPOSAL AND SOLUTION DESIGN

**Step 4.1: Prepare Proposal Materials**

For qualified leads, create customized proposal:

**Proposal Components:**

```
INTIME STAFFING PROPOSAL
[Company Name] - [Date]

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
[1 paragraph explaining InTime's value prop + proposal overview]

**Step 4.3: Present Proposal**

Schedule 20-30 minute follow-up call within 2-3 business days:

**Proposal Presentation Script:**

```
"Thanks for your patience - I've put together a proposal based on our
conversation about [Company]'s need for [X] [Role Type] engineers.

Let me walk you through the key points...

[SITUATION]: We identified your need for [specific need from call]

[SOLUTION]: We're recommending [approach] because [rationale tied to their
business goal]

[TIMELINE]: You said you needed to fill by [Date]. Our process gets you
candidates in [X] days and starts [typical start day], so you should be
well ahead of your target.

[INVESTMENT]: The structure is [explain fee model simply]. Based on [similar
company example], you typically see [X] placements within [timeframe].

[QUESTIONS]: What questions do you have? What would make this feel right to you?
```

**Proposal Follow-Up Option A: Accept (Thumbs Up)**
- Move to Step 5: MSA negotiation and vendor registration

**Proposal Follow-Up Option B: Modify (Thumbs Sideways)**
- Ask: "What would you change to make this work?"
- Common modifications: Fee negotiation, timeline, exclusivity
- Revise and re-present within 2 business days

**Proposal Follow-Up Option C: Decline (Thumbs Down)**
- Ask: "What's not working about this approach?"
- Attempt pivot: "Would a different fee structure work?" or "Would contract-only vs. permanent work better?"
- If still no: Transition to nurture (stay in contact, monthly check-in for 6 months)

---

### PHASE 5: MSA NEGOTIATION AND VENDOR REGISTRATION

**Step 5.1: Prepare MSA (Master Service Agreement)**

Once prospect is ready to move forward, initiate MSA process:

**Key Terms to Define:**

| Term | InTime Position | Negotiation Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Exclusive vs. Non-Exclusive** | Exclusive preferred | For contract roles: 12-month exclusivity. For permanent: 6-month. Non-exclusive acceptable if rate is higher. |
| **Fee Structure** | Markup model preferred | Contract: 25-35% markup on candidate pay rate OR hourly fee ($X/hour billed to client). Permanent: 20-25% of first-year salary. Negotiate down to 20%/18% if large volume or multi-year commitment. |
| **Payment Terms** | Net 30 preferred | Negotiate to: Net 15 if small company, Net 30 standard, Net 45 acceptable for enterprise. Do not accept Net 60+. |
| **Candidate Guarantee** | 90 days preferred | If candidate leaves or is terminated in 90 days, replace at no charge. Some clients push to 180 days - cap at 120 days max. |
| **Liability Cap** | 1x annual contract value | Standard: neither party liable for indirect damages. Cap liability at total fees paid in preceding 12 months. |
| **Term & Termination** | 2 years preferred | Minimum 1 year, prefer 2 years. Allow termination for cause. Prevent termination without cause in first 90 days. |
| **Rate Increases** | 3-5% annual escalation | If multi-year, include CPI or fixed increase (e.g., 3% Year 2, 3% Year 3). |
| **Non-Solicitation** | Standard clause | Candidate cannot hire away InTime consultant for 12 months after placement. |
| **Non-Compete** | Only if requested | InTime agrees not to compete with [Specific Company Name] for [Specific Roles] in [Geography] for [Term]. Keep narrowly defined. |
| **Vendor Compliance** | Client to determine | Clients may require: background checks on candidates, compliance certifications, insurance requirements, data security agreements. Confirm client requirements early. |

**MSA Negotiation Flow:**

1. **InTime sends draft MSA** (within 2 business days of agreement to move forward)
2. **Client Legal reviews** (expect 3-7 business days for response)
3. **Initial comments** (usually requests for higher guarantees, longer terms, lower fees)
4. **BDM + Founder negotiate** (Founder involved for enterprise accounts or significant disagreements)
5. **Revised MSA** (turn-around within 2 business days)
6. **Final review** (1-2 rounds typical)
7. **Signature & Execution** (both parties sign, agreement is live)

**Fee Negotiation Strategy:**

*Client Push:* "Can you do better on price?"

*InTime Response Option A (Defensive):*
"Our current rate of [X]% reflects the full service we provide - including our India ops bench, interview prep, candidate quality assurance, and replacement guarantee. We've priced this competitively against [Competitor A] and [Competitor B]. That said, if you're comfortable with a non-exclusive arrangement, I could move you down to [X-2]%."

*InTime Response Option B (Offensive - Volume Play):*
"If you commit to [X] placements per year or longer term (2+ years), we could move to [X-3]% and build longer-term scale. How many hires per year are we talking?"

*InTime Response Option C (Creative):*
"What if we structure it as: [Lower rate] for first 5 placements, then [Standard rate] after? This way you can validate our quality, then commit longer-term?"

**Common MSA Sticking Points & Solutions:**

| Issue | Client Request | InTime Counter |
|---|---|---|
| Guarantee Period | "180 days" | "We can do 90 days standard, 120 days max for multi-year commitment." |
| Exclusivity | "We want non-exclusive" | "Non-exclusive is 5% higher fee. Or we can do exclusive within [specific skill/geography]." |
| Non-Comp Clause | "2-year non-compete nationwide" | "We'll agree to 1-year, within [City/Region] for [specific roles only]." |
| Data Security | "SOC 2 certified, HIPAA compliance required" | "We have [Certification A], and can add [Certification B] for additional fee if needed." |
| Rate Increase | "No increases for 3 years" | "We need CPI or 2.5% annual increase to offset cost growth. Fixed 2% annual increase is our minimum." |

**Step 5.2: Vendor Registration**

Many companies require vendor registration before engagement:

**Typical Vendor Registration Requirements:**
1. W-9 form (tax identification)
2. Insurance certificate (general liability, typically $1M+)
3. Compliance questionnaire (banking info, government relations, security practices)
4. Background check (company & potentially key employees)
5. Compliance certification (OFCCP compliance, FCRA compliance, I-9 verification)

**Timeline:** Vendor registration typically takes 5-10 business days; plan ahead.

**Action Item List:**
- [ ] Gather W-9 information (InTime's tax ID, address)
- [ ] Obtain insurance certificate of liability (get from InTime's insurance broker)
- [ ] Complete client's vendor registration form (detailed; may take 1-2 hours)
- [ ] Request background check details (if required)
- [ ] Submit package to client's procurement
- [ ] Follow up in 5 business days if not approved
- [ ] Once approved, confirm with client contact

**Step 5.3: MSA Signature and Execution**

Once MSA is finalized:

**Process:**
1. BDM sends final MSA to client contact + legal team
2. Client prints, signs, returns (or uses DocuSign for e-signature)
3. InTime signs (Founder or VP Sales)
4. File copy in deal folder; send executed copy to client
5. Share with operations team: Account Manager, Recruiting Lead

**Signature Email:**

```
[Client Contact],

Thank you for working through this with us. I've attached the final, executed
MSA. This agreement is now in effect as of [Today's Date].

Here's what happens next:
1. We'll schedule a brief kick-off call with our Account Manager [Name]
   within the next 2 business days
2. You'll receive a job intake form to detail your open positions
3. We'll start sourcing immediately once intake is complete
4. You should see qualified candidates within [X] days

I'm excited about the partnership. Looking forward to helping [Company] scale
your team.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Best,
[BDM Name]
```

- Log in CRM with all terms
- Schedule 30-60 day check-in (BDM + Account Manager)
- Flag 6-month renewal conversation trigger (for BDM to conduct expansion/upsell)

## 6. OUTREACH TEMPLATES AND SCRIPTS

**LinkedIn Message Template #1 (Direct Message)**

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question for you - your team at [Company] has been on a hiring spree
lately (saw you posted [X] engineering roles in the past month).

I work with growth-stage tech companies to source engineering talent faster
than traditional recruiting. Most of the teams I work with tell me their
internal hiring process takes 12+ weeks - we cut that to 2-3 weeks.

If you ever need [Specific role type] engineers on contract or permanent basis,
worth a brief conversation. If not, no worries - I'll stay in your network.

[Your Name]
```

**LinkedIn Message Template #2 (Connection + Follow-up)**

```
[INITIAL CONNECTION MESSAGE]
Hi [First Name],

Saw you've been leading the engineering team at [Company] - impressive track
record, particularly with [Specific technology or initiative].

Would love to stay connected and learn more about what you're building.

[YOUR NAME]

[FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE 3-4 DAYS LATER, if they accept]
Hi [First Name],

Thanks for connecting. I know a lot of engineering leaders I work with at
[Similar Company Size/Industry] are facing similar challenges on hiring timelines.

I specialize in getting engineering talent sourced fast (typically 2-3 weeks
to qualified candidates vs. 12+ weeks internally).

No pressure, but if you ever need support scaling [Type of team], happy to
discuss. Otherwise, let's stay connected.

[Your Name]
```

**Email Template #1 (Value-First Approach)**

```
Subject: How [Company] can hire engineers 2-3x faster

Hi [First Name],

I was just looking at [Company]'s careers page and noticed [X] open engineering
roles - looks like you're growing fast in [Specific Area: cloud, AI, mobile, etc.].

Here's what I'm seeing with clients in your space: Most engineering leaders tell
me the biggest bottleneck isn't finding candidates - it's the sourcing and
screening process eating up 12-16 weeks.

I work with [Similar Company 1] and [Similar Company 2] on a simpler model:
- Week 1: You submit requirements
- Week 2: We source + screen qualified candidates
- Week 3: Candidates start interviews
- Week 4+: Placements begin

Our secret: we maintain a pre-screened bench of [X]+ engineers and run a rapid
screening process. Most clients see candidates in 2-3 weeks vs. 12+ weeks
internally.

Worth a quick 15-min call to explore? No obligation.

[Your Name]

**Email Template #2 (Problem Identification)**

```
Subject: [Company]'s hiring growth challenge

Hi [First Name],

I do staffing for [Industry] tech companies, and I've noticed [Company] is
actively hiring for [Role Type].

One pattern I see: companies at [Company]'s stage want to hire [X] engineers,
but their internal recruiting process can't keep up with demand. It creates a
bottleneck.

Have you experienced that? If so, would be worth a quick call to discuss how
other companies solved it.

If not, or if you're all set on recruiting, no worries - just wanted to reach out.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Cold Call Script**

```
[Prospect picks up]

OPENER (11 seconds):
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] from InTime - I know you don't know me,
so I'll be brief. The reason I'm calling is I was looking at [Company]'s open
engineering roles, and I think we might be able to help fill those faster than
your internal process. Do you have 30 seconds?"

[Wait for yes/no - if no, ask for best time to reach out]

VALUE PROP (20 seconds):
"We work with [Similar Company] and [Similar Company 2] to source engineering
talent in 2-3 weeks. Most teams tell us their internal process takes 12+ weeks.
We're faster because we have a bench of pre-screened engineers and a streamlined
sourcing process."

SOFT ASK (15 seconds):
"Would it make sense to grab 15 minutes next week so I can show you how this
works? I'll only take a few minutes, and you can decide if it's worth exploring."

[If yes]: "Perfect. Let me send you a calendar invite. What email should I use?"

[If no]: "Totally understand - you're probably busy. Would it be okay if I
reached out again in a few months when hiring priorities might shift?"

TOTAL TIME: 45 seconds - 1 minute

## 8. KEY DECISION FRAMEWORKS

**Should I Continue Pursuing This Lead? (Go/No-Go Decision Matrix)**

Ask these questions:
1. Do they meet ICP criteria? (Yes / No / Partial)
2. Is there a real, immediate need? (Yes / No / Future)
3. Is the prospect a decision-maker or can they get us to one? (Yes / No)
4. Is there budget (explicit or implicit)? (Yes / No / Likely)
5. Is the timeline clear and reasonable? (Yes / No / Unclear)
6. Are they open to using external staffing? (Yes / No / Unsure)

**Scoring:**
- 6 yes = Pursue aggressively (prospect)
- 4-5 yes = Pursue moderately (nurture)
- 3 or fewer yes = Move to long-term nurture or drop (low probability)

**When to Escalate to Founder/VP Sales:**

- Deal size: >$300K annual contract value
- Strategic importance: Founder relationship, market entry, or key reference
- Executive buyer: C-level (CTO, CFO, CEO) requires founder credibility
- Complex negotiation: Legal, compliance, or terms significantly outside standard
- Stalled deal: Dead for 2+ weeks despite BDM effort; needs executive touch

## 10. COMMON SCENARIOS AND DECISION TREES

**Scenario 1: Prospect Not Responding to Outreach**

```
After 3 touches (LinkedIn message, 2 emails) with no response:

Option A: Warm Transfer
- Can anyone in InTime network refer you? (Founder, existing client, partner)
- If yes: Get warm intro; restart outreach from referral angle

Option B: Alternative Contact
- Can you identify different stakeholder at company? (Different VP Eng, HR Director)
- If yes: Research new contact; adjust outreach angle; restart sequence

Option C: Phone Outreach
- Do you have phone number? Can you dial directly?
- If yes: Make phone call; quick 30-sec pitch

Option D: Move to Nurture
- If no response after 4+ touches over 4 weeks: Move to nurture list
- Action: Send monthly "staying in touch" email; flag for outreach in 6 months
```

**Scenario 2: They Want Lower Fees Than Standard**

```
Client says: "Your fee is 30%, but I can get competitor for 20%."

Option A: Defend at Full Price
"Our fee includes [specific service]. If you go with competitor for 20%, what
happens if the candidate doesn't work out? We guarantee replacement for 90 days.
Do they?" [If no = justify fee]

Option B: Volume Play
"If you commit to [X] placements per year or [X]-year term, I can move to 25%.
That lock-in allows us to build capacity." [Get multi-year deal]

Option C: Partial Concession
"I can do 28% if this is exclusive and you commit to us as your primary vendor."
[Trade fee for exclusivity/volume]

Option D: Walk Away
"I understand the price sensitivity. Our model is built around quality and
guarantee. If price is the key driver, we may not be right fit. Let's explore
this more - what else matters besides fee?" [Get back to value prop]
```

**Scenario 3: Deal Stalled in Negotiation (2+ weeks)**

```
MSA is in client legal, no response for 2+ weeks.

Day 1: Email client contact: "Just checking in - any questions from legal team?"

Day 5: If no response: Phone call to client contact: "Hey, wanted to see if
there are any blockers from legal we can address. Happy to jump on a call
with their team."

Day 10: If still stalled: Escalate to founder/VP Sales for executive call
to client stakeholder: "I know legal is reviewing - are there specific concerns
we can address to help move this forward?"

Day 15: Decision: Offer to move forward on temp terms pending final signature?
Or move deal to "stalled" status?

Key: Don't let deals languish >2 weeks. Escalate and actively unblock.
```
