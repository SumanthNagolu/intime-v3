  - Check daily metrics: submissions, placements, sourcing volume, conversion rates
  - Identify urgent blockers or escalations
  - Provide real-time coaching on active issues
  - Monitor mood/morale indicators

- **Outreach** (5 min)
  - Slack check-ins with team members showing signs of struggle
  - Celebrate daily wins (placements, client wins, candidate breakthroughs)
  - Answer blocking questions immediately

#### Weekly Activities
- **KPI Review with Each Team Member** (30 min per person)
  - Actual vs. target for owned metrics
  - Pipeline analysis: opportunities in motion, conversion rates
  - Gap identification: what's missing to hit targets
  - Action items: what they'll focus on next week
  - Document outcomes in platform notes

- **Pipeline Analysis** (60 min team-wide)
  - Supply lead: sourcing metrics, candidate quality, time-to-availability
  - Demand lead: client wins, fill rate, average days-to-fill
  - Delivery team: consultant satisfaction, repeat clients, issues
  - Cross-functional blockers: what's holding progress up
  - Adjustments needed for following week

#### Monthly Activities
- **Performance Trend Analysis** (120 min)
  - Individual trends (4-week rolling): increasing, stable, declining
  - Cohort performance: interns vs. experienced, by tenure
  - Attribution: external factors (market, seasonality) vs. controllable factors
  - Intervention decisions: who needs support, who's ready for growth
  - Goal adjustments: reforecasting targets based on learnings

- **Metrics Ownership Matrix**

  | Role | Primary Metrics | Cadence |
  |------|-----------------|---------|
  | Supply Lead | Candidates sourced/month, quality score, time-to-submission, candidate satisfaction | Weekly |
  | Demand Lead | New client logos, active pipeline, fill rate, average days-to-fill | Weekly |
  | Delivery Manager | Placement retention (90-day), client satisfaction, repeat clients, issues resolved | Weekly |
  | Bench Lead | Bench utilization rate, time-to-placement from bench, bench cycle time | Weekly |
  | Recruiting Lead | Candidate-to-placement conversion, submissions per recruiter, quality of fits | Weekly |

- **Underperformance Triggers**

  | Metric | Threshold | Action |
  |--------|-----------|--------|
  | Weekly submissions | <50% of target for 2 consecutive weeks | Coaching conversation (form) |
  | Fill rate | <40% of target for 1 month | Resource review, process audit |
  | Client satisfaction | NPS < 7 | Escalation to CEO, intervention plan |
  | Quality (rejection rate) | >25% for 2 weeks | Immediate feedback, training, reduced load |
  | Attendance | <95% (without approved reasons) | Discussion with lead |

- **Intervention Playbook**
  1. **Coaching Conversation** (Structured)
     - What metrics are off target?
     - What's the person's perspective (obstacles, learning curve, personal factors)?
     - What resources or support would help?
     - Agree on 1-2 specific actions for next week
     - Document and follow up in 1 week

  2. **Resource Adjustment**
     - If capacity is issue: reduce workload by 25%, paired with high performer
     - If skill is issue: assign training, pair with mentor, reduce variety initially
     - If motivation is issue: one-on-one career discussion, role adjustment

  3. **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Trigger**
     - Triggered: After coaching + resources, no improvement for 4 weeks
     - Duration: 30-60 days with clear weekly milestones
     - Ownership: HR formality, but immediate manager drives daily support
     - Outcome: Improvement (remove from PIP) or transition out

### 1.2 People Development

#### 1:1 Meeting Cadence and Structure

**Frequency:**
- Interns: Weekly (30 min)
- Experienced team members: Bi-weekly (30 min)
- Leads report to CEO: Bi-weekly (45 min)

**Agenda Template (standardized):**
```
1. Wins & Progress (5 min): What went well this period?
2. Challenges & Blockers (5 min): What's getting in the way?
3. Metrics & Performance (5 min): How are you tracking to goals?
4. Development & Learning (10 min): Skills to develop, training needs, feedback
5. Career & Growth (3 min): Where do you want to go?
6. Action Items (2 min): What will you do before our next 1:1?
```

**Documentation:**
- Notes captured in platform immediately after meeting
- Key blockers flagged for team leads
- Action items added to person's backlog with due dates
- Development themes tracked over time (patterns)

#### Coaching Model: GROW Framework

Use GROW for all development conversations:

| Phase | Questions | Facilitator Role |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Goal** | What do you want to achieve? By when? | Clarify, don't assume |
| **Reality** | Where are you now? What's the gap? | Listen, ask probing questions |
| **Options** | What are 3-4 ways you could close this gap? | Suggest, but let them lead |
| **Will** | Which option will you choose? When will you start? | Commit to accountability |

**Example:** Intern struggling with placement conversations
- Goal: Conduct placement conversations that result in 80% acceptance rate
- Reality: Currently at 60%; feels rushed in calls, over-explaining rather than listening
- Options: (1) Record and review calls, (2) shadow 3 calls with mentor, (3) script first 2 minutes, (4) practice with role-play
- Will: Try option 2 this week, record own calls starting week 2, review together weekly

#### Individual Development Plans (IDP)

**For all team members at hire + annually:**

```
Name: [Person]
Current Role: [Title]
Target Role (12-24 months): [Title]

Current Strengths:
- [Skill A - demonstrated how]
- [Skill B - demonstrated how]

Development Areas (Prioritized):
1. [Skill C - why it matters, success criteria]
2. [Skill D - why it matters, success criteria]

Development Plan:
- [Activity 1: timeline, lead person, success metrics]
- [Activity 2: timeline, lead person, success metrics]

Milestones:
- [Month 3 milestone]
- [Month 6 milestone]
- [Month 12 milestone]

Review cadence: Monthly with manager, quarterly with CEO
```

#### Career Pathing

**InTime Career Progression:**

| Level | Title | Tenure Range | Key Characteristics |
|-------|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| 0 | Intern | 0-3 months | Learning, observation, shadowing |
| 1 | Junior | 3-12 months | Independent on core tasks, needs mentoring on complex |
| 2 | Mid-level | 12-24 months | Owns functional area, mentors juniors, process improvement |
| 3 | Senior | 24+ months | Expertise, leadership, strategic thinking, mentors multiple |
| 4 | Lead | Proven senior | Team leadership, cross-functional strategy, people development |

**Promotion Criteria:**

Each progression requires:
1. **Demonstrated Performance** (90+ days at current level, metrics consistently at/above target)
2. **Skill Development** (IDPs met, feedback consistently positive)
3. **Readiness Assessment** (manager + peer input, CEO approval)
4. **Opportunity Availability** (role exists or can be created)

**Timeframes:**
- Intern → Junior: 6-12 months (most interns reach by 6 months)
- Junior → Mid: 12-24 months (typically 18 months of solid performance)
- Mid → Senior: 24+ months (requires expertise + mentoring success)
- Senior → Lead: Proven senior + leadership capacity (varies, 24-36 months from mid)

**Promotion Process:**
```
1. Manager identifies readiness in 1:1 (month 4-5 if intern, otherwise opportunistic)
2. Manager prepares brief (one-page summary of achievement + readiness)
3. Manager + peer feedback interview (10-15 min conversations)
4. CEO approval + discussion of new role scope
5. Announce promotion, adjust compensation, clarify new expectations
6. 30-day check-in to ensure smooth transition
```

| Delivery Manager | Active placements managed | 15-20 | 25 | Ongoing client/consultant care |
| BDM | Active prospects | 20-30 | 40 | Varies by sales cycle stage |

**Load Balancing Triggers:**

- **Trigger 1:** Individual at >120% of maximum workload for 1 week
  - Action: Redistribute 20% of work immediately to team member with <80% utilization

- **Trigger 2:** Individual at maximum for 2+ consecutive weeks
  - Action: Escalate to CEO, consider temp hiring, prioritization, or scope reduction

- **Trigger 3:** Team utilization >100% average

- Persistent issue: Role redesign conversation, career path discussion
- Critical risk: Immediate escalation to CEO, potential role change or leave

**Wellness Culture:**
- Encourage time off (minimum 15 days/year observed)
- No Slack after 7 PM or weekends (respect boundaries)
- Flexible hours (India-based team, US client coverage)
- Monthly wellness check-in: "What would make your work better?"

Review Date: [When will we reassess - especially for experiments]
```

**Examples:**

```
Date Decided: Jan 15, 2026
Decision Maker: CEO
Decision Type: Type 1
Decision: Approve new BDM hire (Sarah Chen) at $60K + 5% commission
Context: Current BDM overwhelmed (40+ prospects in pipeline), sales cycle suffering
Alternatives Considered: (1) Keep current pace with overload, (2) Hire another BDM, (3) Outsource to recruitment agency, (4) Implement CRM to improve efficiency
Criteria: Speed to impact, cost, quality of hire, cultural fit
Rationale: BDM hire solves problem in 2 weeks (vs. CRM which takes 2 months). Sarah's background ideal (3 years staffing sales, knows IT market)
Expected Impact: +50% new opportunities in pipeline in 6 weeks, +10% close rate
Implementation: Sarah starts Feb 1; Recruiting Lead manages onboarding; BDM Lead trains on process
Review Date: April 1 (assess new opportunity generation, deal velocity)
```

```
Date Decided: Jan 18, 2026
Decision Maker: Supply Lead
Decision Type: Type 2
Decision: Prioritize senior Java developers (5+ years) over junior Java developers in sourcing
Context: Client feedback shows juniors have 30% rejection rate; seniors have 5% rejection rate
Alternatives Considered: (1) Continue balanced approach, (2) Juniors only (test new market), (3) Seniors only, (4) Hybrid with quality filter
Criteria: Candidate quality, submission-to-placement conversion, client satisfaction
Rationale: Seniors strategy reduces wasted effort (lower rejection = faster placements), improves team efficiency
Expected Impact: +5% fill rate, -2 weeks average days-to-fill
Implementation: Re-target sourcing profiles to senior only; communicate to recruiters
Review Date: Feb 15 (check fill rate impact, rejection rate)
```

## 5. Change Management

### 5.1 Process Changes

**Timeline:** 2 weeks planning + 1 week pilot + 1 week rollout = 4 weeks total

**Steps:**

| Phase | Timeline | Actions | Owner | Approval |
|-------|----------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Identify Need** | Week 1 | Problem identified, business case documented | Team Lead/CEO | CEO |
| **Design** | Week 1-2 | New process documented, training materials drafted | Team Lead | Team Lead + CEO |
| **Pilot** | Week 3 | 2-3 volunteers test process (1 week), provide feedback | Pilot team | Team Lead |
| **Review** | Week 4 | Analyze pilot results, gather feedback, finalize process | Team Lead + CEO | CEO |
| **Rollout** | Week 4 | Announce change, train team, publish documentation | Team Lead | Team Lead |
| **Support** | Week 5+ | Daily check-ins, coaching, answer questions | Team Lead | Team Lead |
| **Reinforce** | Ongoing | Weekly mentioning in standup, monthly in retro | Team Lead | Team Lead |

**Communication Plan (for any process change):**
1. **Announcement:** Why are we changing? What are we changing? When?
2. **Rationale:** Problem being solved, expected benefits
3. **Training:** How the new process works, step-by-step
4. **Support:** Who to ask if you have questions, daily check-in first week
5. **Reinforcement:** Weekly mention in standup, monthly retrospective check-in

**Example: Change sourcing tool for Supply team**
- **Week 1 (Identify):** Current tool is slow (5 sec/search), losing productivity. New tool (Tool B) is 2x faster. Business case: save 2 hours/week per sourcer × 2 sourcers = 4 hours/week = $200/week = $10K/year
- **Week 2 (Design):** New process mapped, training guides drafted, data migration plan
- **Week 3 (Pilot):** 2 sourcers use new tool for 1 week, feedback: "Much faster, learning curve 2 hours, small UI confusion"
- **Week 4 (Review):** Feedback incorporated, decision to rollout with 30-min onboarding. Updated docs.
