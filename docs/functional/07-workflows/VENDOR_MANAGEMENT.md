# Vendor Management Process Documentation

## 1. Overview

### What is Vendor Management in IT Staffing?

Vendor management in IT staffing refers to the systematic process of identifying, qualifying, onboarding, and maintaining relationships with external staffing vendors, implementation partners, and system integrators who provide talent requirements and business opportunities. In InTime's case, vendors are our primary revenue channel—they award us staffing projects and consulting opportunities that we fulfill through our Academy-trained talent pool.

### Why Vendor Management Matters

Approximately **80%+ of InTime's staffing revenue flows through vendor relationships**. Unlike pure direct placement agencies, our business model emphasizes deep partnerships with:
- **Tier-1 system integrators** (Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, Wipro, Deloitte, Accenture)
- **Implementation partners** who need specialized sub-contractor capacity
- **MSP/VMS programs** that manage enterprise staffing pools
- **Vendor managers** seeking reliable, compliant, technology-specialized partners

Strong vendor relationships directly impact:
- Requirement volume and pipeline stability
- Revenue predictability
- Margin optimization
- Market intelligence and trend visibility
- Access to premium clients through partner networks

**Rate Negotiation Framework:**

**Understanding the Margins:**
- End-client pays vendor (our cost to vendor)
- Vendor pays InTime (our revenue)
- InTime pays consultant (our cost)
- Spread = Vendor payment to InTime - Consultant cost

**Typical Spread Model by Vendor Tier:**

| Tier | Target Spread | End-Client Bill Rate (Example) | InTime Revenue | Consultant Cost | InTime Margin |
|------|---------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Tier 1 | $15-18/hr | $85/hr | $50-52/hr | $35 | $15-17/hr |
| Tier 2 | $12-15/hr | $70/hr | $42-45/hr | $30 | $12-15/hr |
| Tier 3 | $10-12/hr | $60/hr | $38-40/hr | $28 | $10-12/hr |

**Negotiation Principles:**
- Lead with InTime's value: Academy training, quality assurance, speed, platform, compliance
- Benchmark against market rates (use salary data tools and peer references)
- Build in volume incentives (higher spread for higher volumes)

- Track any consultant departures to vendor
- Document any apparent violations

**Violation Response:**
1. Contact consultant: Determine if solicitation was intentional
2. Notify vendor: Provide specific facts and timeline
3. Request vendor response: Give vendor 5 business days
4. Assess impact: Did consultant leave? Did agreement breach occur?
5. Calculate damages: Fees owed per agreement (typically $5K-25K)
6. Send demand letter or pursue legal action if vendor refuses

**Prevention:**
- Ensure all consultants understand non-solicitation clause
- Educate vendors on non-solicitation policy at kickoff
- Include non-solicitation clause in placement communications

---

### Data Protection Requirements

**Objective:** Protect sensitive company and consultant information

**Vendor Data Security Requirements:**
- Must use secure communication (no unencrypted email for sensitive data)
- Must not share InTime data with third parties without permission
- Must delete InTime data upon request or engagement termination
- Must implement basic data protection (passwords, not public folders)
- Must comply with applicable data protection laws (GDPR if EU, CCPA if CA, etc.)

**Data Handling Best Practices:**
- Share only necessary information with vendors
- Use NDA to define what data is confidential
- Mark documents as confidential
- Request data back or destruction upon engagement end
- Do not share complete consultant details until placement is confirmed

**Incident Response:**
- If vendor loses data or experiences breach: Escalate immediately
- Require vendor to notify affected parties
- Document incident in vendor file
- Assess whether relationship should continue

---

### Background Check Coordination

**Objective:** Ensure all placed consultants meet client background check requirements

**Vendor Responsibilities vs. InTime Responsibilities:**

**InTime Handles:**
- Initial background check (criminal, education, employment verification)
- Check is performed before consultant is submitted
- Results are reviewed and cleared

**Vendor/Client Handles:**
- Client-specific background checks (additional requirements)
- Often more stringent or specialized (government, finance, healthcare)
- Client pays for check or deducts from first payment
- Vendor/Client communicates directly with consultant

**Coordination Process:**
1. At placement: Confirm client background check requirements
2. Communicate to consultant: What will be checked, timeline
3. Coordinate with vendor: Ensure vendor understands requirements
4. Track: Monitor consultant's background check progress
5. Escalate: If consultant fails check, communicate with vendor immediately

**Common Issues:**
- Consultant was not informed of background check requirement
- Consultant fails check (criminal history, education verification, etc.)
- Client rejects consultant after background check
- Background check delays timeline

---

### Immigration Compliance

**Objective:** Ensure InTime and vendors comply with employment/visa requirements

**Vendor Responsibilities:**
- Verify consultant work authorization (I-9 equivalent)
- Provide consultant visa status information if relevant
- Comply with any visa restrictions on client/location
- Report any changes in visa status

**InTime Responsibilities:**
- Request work authorization documentation from consultant
- Verify consultant is eligible for contract work (not on restricted visa)
- Ensure consultant's visa allows consulting work
- Document compliance in consultant file
- Flag any visa expirations for renewal

**Common Visa Types and Restrictions:**
- **H-1B:** Requires sponsorship, usually OK for contract work
- **F-1 (Student):** Limited work authorization, check with school
- **L-1 (Intracompany):** May restrict to sponsoring company only
- **EB-1/EB-2 (Immigrant):** Must verify "Employment is Authorized" status
- **Green Card:** Generally no restrictions

**Vendor Verification:**
- Ask vendor if they verify visa status (they should)
- Request consultant provide proof of work authorization
- Document in placement file
- Escalate any visa-related questions to legal

## 9. Common Vendor Issues and Resolution

### Issue Type 1: Late Payments

**Symptoms:**
- Vendor consistently pays after due date
- Pattern of 10-30 day delays
- Vendor provides excuses (cash flow, accounting issues)

**Investigation:**
- Pull aging report for specific vendor
- Count number of late payments (last 6-12 months)
- Calculate average days late
- Review emails/communications for vendor explanations

**Resolution Steps:**

**If 1-2 late payments (minor):**
1. Send friendly reminder email
2. Ask if there are any issues
3. Confirm payment method and banking info
4. Move forward; monitor closely

**If recurring (3+ times in 6 months):**
1. Schedule call with vendor finance contact
2. Understand root cause (cash flow, accounting, intentional?)
3. If cash flow: Discuss restructured payment plan (e.g., weekly vs. monthly)
4. If accounting: Offer to help clarify invoice format
5. If intentional/unwilling to resolve: Escalate per Section 4

**Escalation to Leadership (if unresolved after 60 days):**
- Document all communications
- Present to Director/VP
- Consider: Requiring prepayment, stopping new work, formal demand letter
- Review vendor agreement for remedies (interest, penalties)

---

### Issue Type 2: Rate Disputes

**Symptoms:**
- Vendor invoices at rate higher than agreed
- Vendor disputes their rate per contract
- Vendor requests unilateral rate increase
- Vendor claims rates are "too low"

**Investigation:**
- Pull signed rate card
- Verify effective date and any amendments
- Review recent invoices for discrepancies
- Compile documentation (emails, agreements)

**Resolution Steps:**

**If invoice rate doesn't match agreement:**
1. Politely point out discrepancy
2. Reference signed rate card and effective date
3. Request corrected invoice at agreed rate
4. Offer to re-send rate card documentation
5. Confirm rate in writing (email recap)

**If vendor disputes the rate itself:**
1. Listen to vendor's concerns (may be legitimate business issue)
2. Acknowledge inflation, market changes (if applicable)
3. Offer to review at next scheduled review date (don't give in midterm)
4. If vendor insists: Offer token increase (2-3%) as goodwill, with formal amendment
5. Escalate if vendor becomes unreasonable or refuses to honor agreement

**If vendor requests unilateral increase without negotiation:**
1. Clearly state: Rates are per signed agreement
2. Remind vendor: We also honor our commitments
3. Explain: Rate increases are negotiated at scheduled reviews
4. Offer: Discuss at next review if business justifies
5. Escalate to leadership if vendor threatens to stop providing requirements

**Prevention:**
- Always get rate agreement in writing (email confirmation at minimum)

- Send rate confirmation email after each rate conversation

---

### Issue Type 3: Consultant Complaints

**Symptoms:**
- Consultant reports issue with client/vendor behavior
- Vendor treated consultant unfairly
- Vendor did not pay consultant (vendor's responsibility)
- Consultant wants to leave placement due to vendor issue

**Investigation:**
- Contact consultant: Get specific details and timeline
- Document all facts (dates, quotes, context)
- Determine if issue is vendor's responsibility or client's responsibility
- Collect any supporting communications/evidence

**Resolution Steps:**

**If vendor is responsible (e.g., vendor promised bonus, didn't deliver):**
1. Contact vendor manager: Present facts clearly
2. Ask for explanation: Give vendor chance to respond
3. Request resolution: What will vendor do to fix?
4. Follow-up: Confirm vendor has addressed issue with consultant
5. Document resolution in CRM

**If client is responsible (e.g., client behavior issue):**
1. Inform consultant: This is client issue, not vendor issue
2. Offer support: Help navigate if safe/appropriate
3. Document: Note in consultant file for future reference
4. Consider: Replace consultant if situation is intolerable

**If vendor is unresponsive or dismissive:**
1. Escalate: Inform relationship owner and leadership
2. Escalate internally: Consultant satisfaction is critical metric
3. Escalate to vendor: Senior management if needed
4. Consider: This indicates relationship health problem
5. Monitor: Track if similar complaints arise

---

### Issue Type 4: Requirement Cancellations

**Symptoms:**
- Vendor submits requirement, we fulfill it, then cancels
- Consultant starts assignment, vendor cancels mid-engagement
- Pattern of cancellations (unreliable)
- Vendor cancels but doesn't notify consultant/InTime promptly

**Investigation:**
- Review specific cancellation (when, why, who notified)
- Determine impact: Consultant stranded? Invoice already submitted?
- Identify pattern: One-off or recurring?
- Assess if vendor is responsible or external cause (client cancellation)

**Resolution Steps:**

**If one-off cancellation:**
1. Confirm reason (client decision? Project change?)
2. Discuss fair notice requirements (typically 2-4 weeks)
3. Discuss compensation: InTime/consultant owed payment for work done or notice period
4. Document and move forward

**If vendor is being irresponsible with cancellations:**
1. Send email: Outline cancellation policy per agreement
2. Explain: Need fair notice (minimum 2-4 weeks) for consultant/InTime
3. Establish: Cancellation with <7 days notice incurs 50% penalty
4. Escalate: If pattern continues, escalate to leadership

**If consultant is stranded (no warning):**
1. Immediately support consultant: Find alternative placement or guarantee payment
2. Invoice vendor: For notice period or minimum engagement hours
3. Send formal notification to vendor: This is agreement breach
4. Demand: Commitment to reasonable notice on future cancellations
5. Escalate if vendor refuses accountability

**Prevention:**
- In placement: Confirm cancellation notice requirement with vendor
- In agreement: Specify penalty for cancellations <7 days notice
- In communication: Always confirm end date and notice requirements

---

### Issue Type 5: Non-Solicitation Violations

**Symptoms:**
- Consultant reports vendor contacted them about direct employment
- Consultant notices vendor recruited them on LinkedIn
- Consultant informs us vendor offered them direct hire position
- Consultant leaves to work for vendor directly

**Investigation:**
- Contact consultant: Get specific facts (what was offered? when? by whom?)
- Ask: Did you agree to leave? Did you accept offer?
- Gather evidence: Emails, LinkedIn messages, chat records
- Timeline: When did contact occur relative to InTime placement?

**Resolution Steps:**

**If contact was made but consultant declined:**
1. Contact vendor: Present facts
2. Reference non-solicitation clause in agreement
3. Warn: This is violation of agreement
4. Request: Confirmation from vendor manager that it won't happen again
5. Document: In CRM and with letter
6. Monitor: Watch for future violations

**If consultant accepted and is leaving:**
1. Gather documentation: Dates, how much notice, whether in middle of contract
2. Assess damages: Fee per agreement (typically $5K-25K depending on contract value)
3. Send invoice: To vendor for non-solicitation fee
4. If vendor refuses: Send formal demand letter with legal review
5. Escalate: Consider litigation if amount is large

**If pattern of violations by same vendor:**
1. Document all incidents
2. Send formal demand letter: Detailing all violations and requesting $X in damages
3. Add clause: Any future violations = immediate termination of relationship
4. Escalate to leadership: Discuss whether to continue relationship
5. Monitor closely: Next violation = immediate termination

**Prevention:**
- Educate consultants: Understand non-solicitation clause
- Educate vendors: Non-solicitation is taken seriously
- Monitor: Check-in with consultants about vendor contact

- Check with team: Have others had issues?
- Review agreement: What remedies do we have?

**Resolution:**
- **Immediate:** Cease all business with vendor
- **Secure:** Protect any sensitive data shared with vendor
- **Notify:** Inform vendor of termination (if contact is safe)
- **Document:** Detailed incident report with evidence
- **Legal:** Consider whether legal action or report to authorities is warranted
