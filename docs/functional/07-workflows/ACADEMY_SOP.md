## Student Issue Management

### Common Issues & Resolution Process

**Owner:** Training Lead + Trainer + Training Coordinator

#### Issue Categories & Interventions

| Issue | Prevention | Early Detection | Intervention |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Attendance Issues | Clear expectations, engagement | Check weekly | Call parents, discuss barriers, support |
| Concept Struggles | Quality instruction, varied teaching | Weekly assessment review | 1-on-1 tutoring, additional labs |
| Behavioral Problems | Classroom norms, culture building | Trainer feedback, peer reports | Conversation with student, expectations reset |
| Technical Problems | Equipment verification, IT support | Early feedback | Troubleshooting, equipment replacement |
| Personal Issues | Safe space, supportive culture | Student vulnerability, check-ins | Counseling referral, flexible accommodations |
| Motivation Dip | Relevant projects, success experiences | Engagement drop-off | Encourage, show progress, adjust pace |

#### Attendance Concerns

**Trigger:** Missing 2+ classes in a week or pattern emerging

**Intervention Process:**
1. **Day 1:** Trainer mentions absence informally
2. **Day 2:** Trainer or Coordinator calls student to check in
3. **Day 3:** Investigate reason: illness, family, personal, technical, etc.
4. **Day 4:** Create support plan if needed
   - Compressed schedule? Additional support?
   - Personal issue? Flexible attendance?
   - Health issue? Medical accommodations?
5. **Follow-up:** Monitor improved attendance

**Escalation:** If attendance falls below 75% cumulative, discuss with Training Lead. May affect graduation eligibility.

#### Academic Struggling

**Trigger:** Assessment score below 60% or declining trend

**Intervention Process:**
1. **Immediate:** Schedule 1-on-1 session with trainer (30-45 mins)
2. **Diagnosis:** Identify specific concepts causing confusion
3. **Support Plan:** Create additional resources and practice
   - Extra lab sessions
   - Pair programming with peer mentor
   - Video explanations of concepts
   - Supplementary materials
4. **Follow-up Assessment:** Retake assessment or targeted quiz
5. **Progress Check:** Weekly check-ins with trainer for 2-3 weeks

**If Persistent (Multiple Failing Assessments):**
- Meeting with Training Lead, student, and trainer
- Discuss options: Continue with additional support, defer to next cohort, exit program
- Document decision

#### Behavioral or Conduct Issues

**Examples:** Disrespect, cheating, inappropriate behavior, disruption

**Process:**
1. **Private Conversation:** Trainer/Coordinator addresses behavior
2. **Expectation Reset:** Review code of conduct and classroom norms
3. **Consequence:** Verbal warning or written warning (documented)
4. **Escalation (if repeated):** Meeting with Training Lead
5. **Final Steps:** Possible suspension or removal (serious cases)

**Cheating Policy:** Immediate investigation and discussion with student and Training Lead. May result in failure of assessment, removal from program, or prosecution.

#### Health or Personal Crisis

**When student discloses personal issue (family death, illness, mental health, etc.):**

1. **Listen and Validate:** Show empathy and support
2. **Assess Needs:** What accommodations would help?
3. **Connect Resources:** EAP, counseling, financial aid, medical leave options
4. **Create Plan:** Flexible attendance, deadline extensions, etc.
5. **Check In:** Regular support and follow-ups
6. **Documentation:** File notes about accommodations for confidentiality

During overlap week (Week 7 for Cohort B / Week 1 for Cohort C):
- Trainer 2 supports Cohort B final week
- Trainer 1 leads Cohort C launch
- TA assists as needed
```

#### Facility & Room Management

**Requirements:**
- 1 dedicated classroom per active cohort
- Lab computers (15-20 per cohort) with required software
