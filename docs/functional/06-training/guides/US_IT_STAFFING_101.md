## Understanding Rates

### Rate Structure

```
BILL RATE = What client pays (per hour)
PAY RATE = What candidate gets (per hour)
SPREAD = Bill Rate - Pay Rate (our profit)
MARGIN % = Spread ÷ Bill Rate × 100
```

### Example Calculation

```
Client pays us:        $75/hr (Bill Rate)
We pay candidate:      $60/hr (Pay Rate)
We keep:               $15/hr (Spread)
Margin:                20% ($15 ÷ $75)

Annual numbers (assuming 2,000 hrs/year):
Client pays:           $150,000
Candidate gets:        $120,000
We keep:               $30,000 (Gross Profit)
```

### Rate Factors

| Factor | Higher Rates | Lower Rates |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Skills | Rare/specialized | Common |
| Experience | 8+ years | Entry level |
| Location | SF, NYC | Remote, low COL |
| Demand | Hot skill, urgent | Easy to fill |
| Visa | Citizen, GC | H1B, OPT |
| Direct/Sub | Direct client | Multiple layers |

### Typical Rate Ranges (2024-2025)

| Role/Skill | Junior | Mid | Senior | Lead |
|------------|--------|-----|--------|------|
| Java Developer | $45-55 | $60-75 | $80-100 | $100-130 |
| Python Developer | $50-60 | $65-80 | $85-110 | $110-140 |
| .NET Developer | $45-55 | $55-70 | $75-95 | $95-120 |

## Employment Types

### W2 (Employee)

**What it is:** Candidate is employee of staffing company.

- Benefits (if offered)
- Workers' comp
- Unemployment insurance

**Candidate gets:**
- Regular paycheck (taxes withheld)

- Benefits (if offered)

**Rate impact:** W2 rate is lower than C2C because we cover taxes/overhead.

### C2C (Corp-to-Corp)

**What it is:** Candidate has their own company (LLC, Inc.) and invoices us.

**They handle:**
- Their own taxes
- Their own benefits
- Their own insurance

**We handle:**

- Simpler administration

**Rate impact:** C2C rate is 10-15% higher than W2 (they pay own taxes).

### 1099 (Independent Contractor)

**What it is:** Individual contractor (no company).

**Caution:** IRS rules on who qualifies are strict!

**Requirements for true 1099:**
- Sets own hours
- Has multiple clients
- Uses own equipment
- Not directed how to work

**Risk:** Misclassification can mean penalties.

### Rate Conversion Example

```
Same take-home pay, different structures:

  - After taxes (~25%): ~$45/hr take-home

C2C: $68/hr (13% higher)
  - They pay own taxes
  - Similar take-home after self-employment tax

When negotiating, understand which type!
