# Design System Documentation

## 🎨 ACTIVE DESIGN SYSTEM

**Use this for ALL development:**
- **[INTIME-DESIGN-SYSTEM-V3.md](./INTIME-DESIGN-SYSTEM-V3.md)** ← **START HERE**

This is the single source of truth for:
- Colors, typography, spacing
- Component patterns
- Layout guidelines
- Code snippets
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## 📋 Module Checklist

When building ANY new feature:

1. Read INTIME-DESIGN-SYSTEM-V3.md
2. Reference Academy module as example
3. Use exact same colors, fonts, spacing
4. Follow component patterns exactly
5. Verify against checklist in design doc

## 🏛️ Reference Implementation

The **Academy module** (`/src/app/students/*`) is the canonical reference.

When in doubt, copy its patterns:
- Card styling
- Navigation structure  
- Typography usage
- Color application
- Spacing patterns
