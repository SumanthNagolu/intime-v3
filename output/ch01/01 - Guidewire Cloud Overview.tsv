0	11160	Welcome to an overview of Guidewire Cloud.
11160	16760	By completing this lesson, you will be able to describe the Guidewire Cloud Applications,
16760	21880	Producer Engage, Policy Center, Customer Engage, Claim Center, and Explorer.
21880	26640	Also, you will be able to explain how Guidewire Cloud Applications help insurers meet three
26640	35640	essential imperatives, engage customers, innovate, and grow efficiently.
35640	41160	Guidewire is the platform P&C insurers trust to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently.
41160	47440	We combine digital, core, analytics, and AI to deliver insurance suite as a cloud service.
47440	51480	Insurers want to be able to engage, provide an innovative experience for their customers,
51480	54360	and ultimately make insurance convenient.
54360	59080	Insurers want to innovate and to rapidly prototype and deploy products faster than ever before.
59080	64360	And, insurers want to be able to grow efficiently, reducing IT complexity and ultimately driving
64360	69120	process improvement.
69120	72640	This course takes you on a tour of insurance suite for the cloud.
72640	78480	We focus on five personas, the broker or agent, the customer service representative or underwriter,
78480	83320	the policyholder, the claims adjuster, and then finally the insurance manager.
83320	87480	As we walk you through the policy lifecycle, you will see those strategic imperatives come
87480	88480	to light.
88480	92720	How to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently through the seamless integration of Guidewire
92720	97160	Insurance Suite, and straight through processing.
97160	102400	The first stop on our tour is Producer Engage.
102400	106640	Producer Engage is the agent-facing part of the Guidewire Cloud Platform.
106640	110560	This digital application supports end-to-end business transactions that are important to
110560	111760	an agent.
111760	116680	Through Producer Engage, agents have access to policy, billing, and claims information
116680	121040	as well as relevant tasks and activities, on a single screen.
121040	125320	Producer Engage is seamlessly integrated with Guidewire Insurance Suite for a 360-degree
125320	126880	view.
126880	132640	Producer Engage enables an agent to find a suitable insurance quote for a customer, complete
132640	141360	a quote, change or cancel a policy, and submit a claim on a client's behalf.
141360	146160	For our tour of Producer Engage, Archie Armstrong, an agent, will demonstrate how straight through
146160	151560	processing streamlines every aspect of his job.
151560	157200	Our demonstration begins with our agent, Archie Armstrong, logging into Producer Engage.
157200	161480	Archie is immediately presented with a Producer Engage dashboard, where he can see at a glance
161480	164460	everything that requires his attention today.
164460	169920	Across the top, a row of dynamic tiles provides quick access to open quotes, endorsements,
169920	173640	open cancellations, and renewals.
173640	177360	Listed below the tiles are all open activities that are assigned to Archie and are due within
177360	179280	the next seven days.
179280	183040	Each activity can be expanded to show its details.
183040	186800	Activities are actionable items that an agent can work on any time.
186800	191480	Activity details include the escalation date as well as the activity type and a brief description.
191480	197760	Currently, there are no activity notes, but Archie could add a note.
197760	201360	After Archie has completed this activity, he marks it as complete.
201360	207200	A hyperlink provides access to the related policy.
207200	208860	Notice the panel on the right.
208860	213240	This demonstrates the ability to access and display information from outside data sources
213240	216560	such as Twitter on the Producer Engage dashboard.
216560	221880	This dashboard, and in fact, all of Producer Engage, is a configurable framework.
221880	225640	The expectation is that customers will want to lightly configure the application for their
225640	231320	particular requirements and introduce their unique look and feel.
231320	235440	The tabs across the top of the screen enable an agent to access any account and to search
235440	237200	for a specific account.
237200	239240	The tiles are built-in filters.
239240	243400	You can filter on recently viewed, recently created, personal accounts, and commercial
243400	244560	accounts.
244560	249680	In the recently viewed area, hyperlinks provide the means to navigate quickly to an account.
249680	252920	Notice there are tabs to access policies and claims.
252920	256600	Producer Engage is seamlessly integrated with Policy Center and Claim Center.
256600	260200	There is also a tab for viewing activities.
260200	264040	Now that you have had a brief tour of Producer Engage, let us go to the Write Construction
264040	266160	account.
266160	269240	Here is the account summary screen for Write Construction.
269240	273480	This screen provides an agent with a 360-degree view of one account.
273480	279040	The screen exposes relevant policies, claims, and billing data, again demonstrating the seamless
279040	282400	integration between Guidewire Insurance Suite products.
282400	286720	You can see summary details that are drawn from Policy Center.
286720	291880	Producer information includes billing details from Billing Center.
291880	296920	The Claims tile provides access to data in Claim Center.
296920	303480	The Contacts tile accesses all contacts that are associated with this account.
303480	305520	Let us click Open Activities.
305520	309600	Here is a list of all open activities related to Write Construction with a button for creating
309600	311080	a new activity.
311080	315920	An agent can view open quotes, open endorsements and transactions in general, and any claims
315920	319640	associated with the account.
319640	323640	The Billing and Payment tile provides access to billing information for the account.
323640	328040	Here, you can set up automatic payments and manually make payments.
328040	331360	Notice the Billing Health check for the account.
331360	335180	Let us return to the summary screen where our Producer can start a new quote.
335180	339320	To initiate a new quote for Write Construction, Archie would start by clicking New Quote for
339320	340320	this account.
340560	345520	Suppose, however, another customer calls while he is viewing the Write Construction account.
345520	349280	Archie can simply click Start New Quote, and he will be prompted to start a quote for any
349280	350760	account.
350760	354080	Archie clicks New Quote for this account to start the submission workflow.
354080	356960	First, he selects his Producer Code.
356960	361160	The Producer Code restricts the products that a given agent can sell.
361160	369480	Archie chooses a commercial property submission for this example.
370480	377600	This is a function of the submission workflow, which is designed to be streamlined and intuitive,
377600	381680	reducing potential customer frustration and redundancy and minimizing the potential for
381680	383840	error.
383840	388120	After Archie clicks Next, the submission work tree is displayed on the left side, showing
388120	391360	the steps of the wizard-driven workflow.
391360	395440	The next step is to add buildings and locations to the submission.
395440	399360	An agent could capture buildings and locations by adding each one manually.
399360	405720	However, Archie chooses to upload an SOV, statement of values, by means of an Excel spreadsheet.
405720	409560	To get started with uploading spreadsheets, you must download the pre-formatted template
409560	411760	first.
411760	420320	Archie selects an SOV that was created earlier.
420320	424600	In a matter of seconds, nine buildings have been imported into Producer Engage.
424600	428480	As you can imagine, this facility is a real-time saver.
428480	432720	Customers working with legacy systems typically need to manually key in all information concerning
432720	434680	buildings and locations.
434680	437160	This task can take hours to accomplish.
437160	441560	The ability to import effortlessly these nine buildings and feed the data into the workflow
441560	444440	significantly streamlines the operation.
444440	448400	Archie chooses building number one for the main office.
448400	451920	Let us take a look at everything that was captured with a click of a button.
451920	455880	Here is the full address with the territory code, the building number, and the property
455880	458160	class code.
458160	462360	All of the coverages have been defaulted based on guidewire offerings, which are essentially
462360	465680	packages of coverages and limits for specific risks.
465680	470360	By using default values for all the coverages, the workflow provides a straight-through, low-touch
470360	472440	underwriting environment.
472440	476520	Of course, Archie can choose to modify the coverages, but the more he deviates from the
476520	480160	defaulted values, the more data he will need to provide.
480160	483720	And the less streamlined the quote cost becomes.
483720	486120	Let us scroll through the coverages.
486120	490560	You can see the building coverage, the business personal property coverage, the business income
490560	495400	coverage, and extra expense coverage as well.
495400	497440	Archie can edit any of these coverages.
497440	500640	However, he decides to accept all the defaults.
500640	506320	He returns to the buildings and locations screen and clicks next.
506320	510040	Now that all nine buildings with limits and coverages have been captured, the workflow
510040	512800	sends the information over to the rating engine.
512800	517480	In the process, any business, underwriting, and reinsurance rules are run against risks
517480	521080	before the rating engine returns the total cost of the quote.
521080	525300	In a matter of minutes, Archie has gone from submission to quoted on a nine-schedule commercial
525300	526800	property quote.
526800	528320	That is impressive.
528320	532520	Archie clicks next and scans the policy information to be sure it is correct.
532520	536200	Notice the email and phone data has been populated with information that was stored with the
536200	539880	account.
539880	542260	The payment details screen is next.
542260	546280	This screen is populated with information drawn from billing center, which includes payment
546280	548700	details and a list of pay plans.
548700	552040	As a side note, guide wire can handle any type of pay plan.
552040	555720	These are created in billing center and exposed on the digital layer.
555720	561360	Archie selects the first plan in the list with 10% down payment and monthly installments.
561360	570440	In the payment options area, Archie enters the payment details and clicks buy now to
570440	576440	kick off the process of binding and issuing the policy.
576440	578320	The payment has been successful.
578320	581620	A unique policy number has been attached to the policy.
581620	588120	This number is hyperlinked in case the agent wants to view or edit the policy data.
588120	591260	If Archie needs to make a change, he can do so here.
592260	593660	He can renew or cancel the policy.
593660	597940	He can also populate the declaration page and print and send the ID cards.
597940	603220	The screen provides all this capability, some of which can also be automated.
603220	611140	Here is the transaction for the new policy with a premium of $29,934.
611140	615900	In this example, you saw how quickly an agent can bind and issue a policy using guide wire
615900	618980	straight through processing workflow capabilities.
618980	623060	Now let us see what happens when an underwriting rule interrupts the process of a new commercial
623060	624780	property submission.
624780	628740	Let us return to the right construction account, where the new policy is listed under issued
628740	630740	policies.
630740	643620	As in the earlier demonstration, Archie starts a new commercial property submission.
643620	655140	He finds and selects the SOV file to upload the spreadsheet.
655140	659220	And here are the nine buildings.
659220	663240	For the purposes of this example, we have created an underwriting rule that raises an
663240	670140	underwriting issue for any building that was constructed earlier than 1990.
670140	674700	Archie opens the main office building number one location to edit the building details.
674700	682380	He types 1984 for the year built and saves the changes.
682380	688060	Then he continues with the same workflow that you saw earlier.
688060	693820	Again, the workflow sends a submission to the rating engine, which returns the total
693820	695340	cost of the quote.
695340	699100	The underwriting rule could have fired now, when the rating engine returns the premium
699100	700100	amount.
700100	705180	However, the rule was designed to fire after Archie selects a pay plan for the policy.
705180	714620	This means all the data will have been captured before the underwriting referral occurs.
714620	727540	Archie enters payment information and clicks buy now.
727540	732820	The underwriting rule fires and returns an error, as we expected.
732820	734500	Archie clicks OK.
734500	738220	An alert on the quote screen informs the agent that underwriting issues have been raised
738220	739500	for this quote.
739500	743900	The issue listed under underwriting issues is building older than 1990, which has blocked
743900	747180	the bind.
747180	751140	Archie decides to refer the issue to the underwriter.
751140	756780	First, he adds a brief note that tells the underwriter it is part of a larger account
756780	758380	that is clean account.
758380	768380	See main office number one.
768380	771900	He clicks confirm.
771900	775300	The quote has been referred to the assigned underwriter for review.
775300	779900	An activity has been created for the underwriter review and approval.
779900	785780	Immediately, Archie sees the new activity, review and approve for commercial property
785780	789820	for right construction assigned to Christine Kraft, the underwriter.
789820	799460	The activity was created by Archie Armstrong with a note for Christine Kraft.
799460	805220	The next stop on our tour of insurance suite for the cloud is policy center.
805220	810100	Policy center provides full end to end policy management and issuance functionality including
810100	815300	quoting, rating, underwriting, policy generation, and statistical reporting.
815300	820260	It offers seamless integration between core functionality and predictive analytics.
820260	826460	Policy center enables agents and underwriters to create and manage policies, handle inquiries
826460	833780	and service accounts, evaluate risks, view policies, create activities.
833780	839860	Policy center brings efficiency to every step from submission to renewal.
839860	844780	In the previous demonstration, we met Archie Armstrong, an agent who created two submissions
844780	846660	using producer engage.
846660	851060	The second submission raised an underwriting issue because of an older building.
851060	855260	In this next demonstration, we meet Christine Kraft, the underwriter who was assigned at
855260	859340	the issue.
859340	862780	Christine Kraft begins by logging into policy center.
862780	866900	Policy center is a role based application, which means everything from screen flow to
866900	872220	access to data is based on permissions granted to Christine's role as an underwriter.
872220	874860	The summary screen is Christine's desktop.
874860	878220	As you can see, the desktop is designed for ease of use.
878220	882300	All the data that is pertinent to Christine's role is either displayed on the screen or is
882300	884500	available at the click of a button.
884500	888140	Here is the review and approve activity for right construction that was just sent from
888140	890180	producer engage.
890180	893940	Before Christine opens the activity, let us take a few minutes to take a brief tour of
893940	895300	policy center.
895300	898940	I have already mentioned the intuitive design of the summary screen.
898940	903380	Like producer engage, policy center is a framework that is intended to be lightly configured
903380	905140	by each customer.
905140	908700	The sidebar on the left contains the actions menu at the top.
908700	910100	This menu is dynamic.
910100	914820	The available menu options vary based on the current context and the role of the user.
914820	923300	For example, from the summary screen, Christine can create a new submission or a new account.
923300	927900	In addition, the sidebar provides menu links for quick access to the summary screen to
927900	932100	activities, submissions, renewals, and so on.
932100	937660	Across the top are tabs for accessing accounts, policies, contacts, and search.
937660	939700	Christine can search by account number.
939700	944220	She can select new account or, on the policy tab, start a new submission.
944220	947140	Policy center has sophisticated search functionality.
947140	951780	The built-in search uses solid platform capability, which provides features such as sounds like
951780	953620	and fuzzy search.
953620	958540	The options available on the administration tab are based on Christine's role and permissions.
958540	963860	Users and security gives her access to users, organizations, producer codes, and so on.
963860	973180	Now, let us look at the right construction account.
973180	976300	Christine clicks the link to the account holder summary dashboard.
976300	980060	An account holder is the primary contact associated with an account.
980060	984780	This screen provides a complete 360-degree picture of the customer relationship and current
984780	988980	interactions by displaying data across all accounts for which the contact is the account
988980	989980	holder.
989980	994980	The account holder summary is especially useful for customer service representatives.
994980	998500	Notice the billing and claims health check on the right-hand side of the screen.
998500	1004580	Below are the policies owned by right construction, any open policy transactions, and open claims.
1004580	1008780	Christine can access the details for a policy or claim by clicking the hyperlink reference
1008780	1009780	number.
1009780	1014540	Again, thanks to seamless integration of insurance suite, she can view policy, claim, and billing
1014540	1017780	data all on the same screen.
1017780	1021420	Christine scrolls back to the top and clicks the link to the account summary for right
1021420	1027620	construction.
1027620	1033380	The overview area provides the ability to recalculate the three-year premium, loss ratio, and total
1033380	1034380	losses.
1034380	1041580	Below that is the billing health check.
1041580	1045740	Here is a list of current activities, then then a list of enforced policies.
1045740	1051780	Christine clicks the first policy number to view the latest policy for right construction.
1051780	1056340	The policy summary screen focuses on a single policy and provides the ability to calculate
1056340	1062820	the term financials at the policy level.
1062820	1066900	On the my summary screen, Christine examines the recent activity that was sent over by
1066900	1071740	Archie Armstrong, our agent.
1071740	1076100	The activity detail indicates this is a review and approve activity.
1076100	1078300	Christine clicks view notes for details.
1078300	1082020	She sees that this is part of a larger account, which is a clean account.
1082020	1084340	See the main office first location.
1084340	1089180	She puts the submission in edit mode, in case she needs to make any changes.
1089180	1093060	Notice this editable submission has a similar format to the wizard driven workflow that you
1093060	1094740	saw in producer engage.
1094740	1099180	However, as an internal user with the role of underwriter, Christine has more access
1099180	1103380	than agents have when using producer engage.
1103380	1105620	Christine clicks buildings and locations.
1105620	1109220	She knows to look specifically at main office building number one.
1109220	1113380	She notes that the year built is 1984, as Archie entered it.
1113380	1116700	Christine realizes the age of the building should not be a problem because the account
1116700	1119820	is clean, and this is only one of several buildings.
1119820	1125540	This screen provides the same import or export capability that Archie used in producer engage.
1125540	1130300	From here, Christine can proceed to rate the risk.
1130300	1134340	She is routed to the quote screen, where you can see the total cost broken out by total
1134340	1138100	premium and taxes and surcharges.
1138100	1140300	There are also two errors displayed in red.
1140300	1144940	The first error states, this policy has one or more outstanding contingencies.
1144940	1150060	The second error says, this quote will require underwriting approval prior to binding.
1150060	1153740	These messages proactively let the underwriter know that there are some items that need to
1153740	1156780	be taken care of before the policy can be issued.
1156780	1160700	If Christine tries to finish quote, the pre quote issues screen lists the issues that
1160700	1162460	are blocking the quote.
1162460	1165860	Christine's next step is to go to the risk analysis tab and approve the issues that
1165860	1167700	are blocking bind.
1167700	1169860	She clicks the risk analysis tab.
1169860	1173420	The underwriting issues tab is where Christine can view the issues that are blocking the
1173420	1177940	quote and either approve them and continue on with the workflow or reject them.
1177940	1185020	If she approves the issue, she can then bind and issue the policy.
1185020	1187500	Let us look at the predictive analytics tab.
1187500	1192460	The data on this screen illustrates the capability of guidewire predictive analytics.
1192460	1196100	Embedded data and analytics ensure that you know what's working, what's not, and what
1196100	1197100	to do next.
1197100	1201580	Currently, you see data based on pre-built models that are embedded into the workflow.
1201580	1204900	These represent one approach to predictive analytics.
1204900	1209940	Guidewire also supports a BYOM or bring your own models approach by enabling deployment,
1209940	1215020	integration, and monitoring of predictive models created using third party tools.
1215020	1218900	This dashboard shows an example of the risk models that we provide.
1218900	1222580	Profitability, customer retention, and expense reduction.
1222580	1226980	These analytics can be used as suggestions or they can provide input for automation,
1226980	1230420	which is the case for the inspection contingency workflow.
1230420	1234380	Here you can see that a contingency has automatically been attached to the policy based on these
1234380	1243060	predictive analytics.
1243060	1247500	In the demonstration, the predictive analytics dashboard showed an example of how real-time
1247500	1251540	predictive insights are embedded in guidewire core systems.
1251540	1255220	Predictive analytics involves building models to predict future results.
1255220	1259340	It provides guidance to frontline decision makers while continuously measuring business
1259340	1260340	value.
1261260	1264980	Predictive analytics for profitability helps by improving rating sophistication and granularity
1264980	1268220	while identifying and addressing pricing inaccuracies.
1268220	1271220	It improves underwriting profitability.
1271220	1274700	Predictive analytics for claims helps better manage claim indemnity and loss adjustment
1274700	1278420	expenses.
1278420	1283540	In this section, Christine Kraft, an underwriter, took us on a brief tour of policy center,
1283540	1285700	where she handled an underwriting issue.
1285700	1289940	We also visited the predictive analytics dashboard and viewed a contingency that was automatically
1289940	1293740	attached to the policy based on these predictive analytics.
1293740	1298500	The next tour stop is, customer engage account management.
1298500	1302900	Customer engage account management is a digital, self-service application that enables customers
1302900	1306740	to view and manage every aspect of their insurance account.
1306740	1311140	Customers have clear visibility into claim handling processes and operations.
1311140	1315540	Customer engage enriches the overall claims experience for policy holders.
1315540	1320100	Thanks to seamless integration with policy center, claim center, and billing center,
1320100	1324980	customers can view their invoices, policies, and claims, manage bills, make payments, and
1324980	1327140	manage payment schedules.
1327140	1333140	As you will see in our demonstration, a customer can file a claim and update personal information.
1333140	1337180	In the previous demonstrations, we have looked at the policy life cycle from the viewpoint
1337180	1339700	of an agent and then an underwriter.
1339700	1343780	In this next demonstration, we will switch to the customer perspective as we take a tour
1344020	1346020	of customer engage account management.
1346020	1350180	Meet Ben Wright, a customer who needs to file a claim.
1350180	1354820	Ben Wright of Wright Construction begins by logging into customer engage account management.
1354820	1364020	Wright Construction is the same account we have been working with in the previous demonstrations.
1364020	1366820	Ben's home page is the account summary screen.
1366820	1370420	This screen was designed to answer the main questions that customers have when they call
1370420	1372820	a customer service representative.
1372820	1374260	What is my balance?
1374260	1375860	Is anything past due?
1375860	1377780	If so, can I pay it?
1377780	1379620	And when is my next bill?
1379620	1383940	Answers to these questions are clearly displayed across the top of Ben's home screen.
1383940	1386820	Ben can also see all policies held by his account.
1386820	1391700	The account summary screen is another example of the seamless integration of policy, claims,
1391700	1392900	and billing functionality.
1394980	1399140	From this application, Ben can file a first notice of loss for a claim.
1399140	1400340	He can purchase insurance.
1400740	1402820	He can make payments.
1405140	1408900	On the billing summary, Ben can view the billing and payment details for each of the
1408900	1410740	Wright Construction policies.
1410740	1413380	He can also make a payment or set up automatic payments.
1414180	1418260	Similarly, the claims tab provides a list of hyperlinked claim numbers for claims
1418260	1422580	filed by Wright Construction with the status of each claim and the number of the related policy.
1423380	1427060	Ben returns to his home screen and locates the most recent policy.
1427060	1430020	He clicks, file a claim to start a first notice of loss.
1431300	1437220	Guidewire empowers insurers, placing billing, policy, and claims functionality at their fingertips.
1438740	1439940	Here is the new claim tab.
1440580	1445300	Notice the loss date is pre-filled with today's date, and the policy number is pre-selected.
1445300	1449700	After Ben clicks next, the claim information work tree is displayed on the left side,
1449700	1452340	showing the steps of this wizard-driven workflow.
1452340	1456500	The next step is for Ben to describe what happened, why he is filing a claim.
1456500	1459540	He selects the loss cause and enters the date of notice.
1459620	1462340	The important point here is not the details of this claim,
1462340	1465540	but the ease with which an insured is able to capture the claim details.
1469300	1471300	Ben goes on to select the affected building.
1472100	1476580	As anyone who has taken a first notice of loss will attest, this is a stressful situation.
1477140	1481780	Customer engage is designed to make this process as easy and painless as possible.
1481780	1483380	Ben has entered the claim details.
1485140	1489300	He selects the address from a list of addresses associated with his account.
1489300	1494260	In the next step, Ben will have the opportunity to upload any pictures or supporting documents.
1494260	1497780	If there are witnesses or other third parties, he can add them here.
1497780	1500500	Ben simply adds himself as a contact and clicks next.
1510100	1513700	The new claim summary provides Ben the opportunity to make sure the information
1513700	1515220	is correct and complete.
1515220	1516820	And he is ready to submit the claim.
1520260	1522820	The claim has been successfully submitted.
1522820	1525220	A unique claim number has been attached to the claim.
1526020	1529300	Behind the scenes, the workflow has automatically triaged the claim
1529300	1532660	and assigned it to a claims adjuster based on the characteristics of the claim.
1533220	1537220	Productivity is improved by ensuring the right claim to assign to the right adjuster.
1539700	1543060	In this demonstration, Ben Wright, a policyholder,
1543060	1546100	filed a claim using customer engage account management.
1546180	1549300	In the next section, the adjuster who was assigned to the new claim
1549300	1550980	will examine the claim and claim center.
1556020	1559460	Next stop on the tour, claim center and the guidewire cloud platform.
1561860	1566820	Guidewire claim center is the PNC industry's most trusted claims management solution.
1566820	1570580	Claim center manages the entire claims process from first notice of loss
1570580	1572740	through a execution of financial transactions.
1573540	1577940	With claim center, your claims teams have real time access to the information they need
1577940	1579060	when they need it.
1579060	1582980	When Scott logs into claim center, he also has instant access to relevant
1582980	1587140	information stored in policy center, billing center, and contact manager
1587140	1590020	thanks to the seamless integration of all insurance suite products.
1590820	1595380	Claim center enables claims automation to free up your resources to focus on complex
1595380	1600580	claims and easily defines when and how exposures, reserves and activities are created.
1600580	1604820	Claim center ensures compliance with corporate policies and claims best practices
1604820	1606020	throughout your organization.
1609060	1611780	In the previous demonstration, we met Ben Wright,
1611780	1615940	a policyholder who filed a claim using customer engage account management.
1615940	1619860	Based on the claim characteristics, automated workflow has assigned Ben's first
1619860	1622340	notice of loss to Scott Henson, a claims adjuster.
1623060	1626740	In this next demonstration, the persona of Scott, a claim adjuster,
1626740	1628500	will view the new claim and claim center.
1631140	1634260	Scott logs into claim center.
1634260	1637540	Like policy center, claim center is a role based application.
1638100	1642180	Everything that follows from screen flow to data access is based on Scott's role as a
1642180	1643060	claims adjuster.
1643780	1648020	Scott immediately sees two activities on his summary screen that are related to the first
1648020	1652180	notice of loss that Ben filed just minutes ago from customer engage account management.
1652900	1657460	Before Scott addresses the new claim, let us take a few minutes for a brief tour of claim center.
1657780	1662740	As in policy center, the actions menu and claims center is dynamic, varying the menu options that
1662740	1666340	are available to Scott based on his permissions and on the current context.
1666340	1670740	The sidebar provides additional menu links for quick access to activities,
1670740	1674980	claims, exposures, subrogations, pending adjustments, and so on.
1675620	1680580	Across the top in the tab bar, Scott can start a first notice of loss or search for a claim.
1683380	1685380	The team tab, which is available to Scott,
1685860	1690580	the team tab, which is available to managers and supervisors, provides a visual management
1690580	1694580	tool for managing groups that Scott supervises and any subgroups of those groups.
1695300	1698660	At this point, Scott clicks the claim number to examine the new claim.
1699300	1703460	Of course, since this is a new claim, there is not much detail yet.
1703460	1707300	The summary screen provides an overview of how the claim is performing.
1707300	1710100	In the basics area, you see the associated target,
1710100	1713140	which is calculated by a rule and is specific to the insurer.
1713940	1717140	If there were a potential large loss associated with the loss,
1717140	1719700	a high risk indicator would be displayed in the top right.
1720660	1722980	Currently, no exposures are listed for the claim.
1723780	1727620	Guidewire provides an automated exposure and reserve creation capability.
1728260	1730580	Services attached to the claim would be listed here.
1734340	1738980	Scott views the planned activities, which are based on business logic and are part of the claims tree.
1738980	1745060	Notice the health metrics tab, which shows several health metrics that have been run
1745060	1748340	against the claim and indicate how efficiently the claim is being processed.
1749860	1753140	The policy tab gives Scott a view into the policy related to the claim.
1753700	1758420	He can see the locations, coverages, and limits without having to switch back and forth between
1758420	1759940	claim center and policy center.
1762820	1765380	Claim financials are available on the financials tab.
1766020	1768980	Of course, for a new claim, there is not much to show yet.
1771780	1775860	Starting with the first demonstration and ending with this demonstration in claim center,
1775860	1778340	you have now walked through a day in the life of a policy.
1780900	1784180	The final stop on our tour of Guidewire Cloud is Explore.
1784180	1788980	You will see what Guidewire provides from a business intelligence and operational reporting standpoint.
1789540	1794020	Explore is a cloud-native data analytics and visualization application that enables you to
1794020	1797300	explore data from your Guidewire insurance suite applications.
1797300	1801460	Each Explore dashboard includes several visualizations that represent your data.
1802260	1808180	With Explore, you can analyze your data to discover new insights, visualize and collaborate
1808180	1812180	to improve business effectiveness, accelerate decision-making,
1812260	1817300	Explore streams data from core systems and other sources into a scalable data infrastructure to
1817300	1820900	provide near real-time insights and enable smart business decisions.
1822660	1827700	For our final demonstration, Sonya Weber, an insurance manager, will take you on a tour of
1827700	1829540	Guidewire Live Analytics and Explore.
1833860	1838340	Explore is a cloud-only service that provides 10 pre-built operational dashboards,
1838980	1845300	which provide valuable near-real-time insights into claim and policy performance.
1846020	1850980	As an insurance manager, Sonya needs up-to-the-minute feedback on how claims are performing.
1850980	1855940	The first tab Sonya sees is Claim Center Open Inventory Management, which provides an operational
1855940	1860980	overview of how the claim process is performing. The dashboard is fed in near-real-time from our
1860980	1864980	data lake based on claims, and can be used to optimize your claims operations.
1865620	1870020	Sonya sees there are currently 207 open claims, with a total incurred of more than
1870020	1874660	three and a half million dollars. She looks over to the right to view various claim metrics,
1874660	1879620	such as open claims by segment and open claims by assigned group. In the lower left,
1879620	1885140	is claim volume by user which is ordered by overdue activities. These, and other metrics,
1885140	1890580	help Sonya optimize her everyday claims management. An important feature of Explore is the ability to
1890580	1896340	export the data from any of the dashboards in raw or CSV format. Sonya can easily send the charts
1896340	1901220	and figures displayed on her dashboard to a downstream reporting system. Another dashboard
1901220	1905300	that aids Sonya in assessing claim performance is the Claim Center Activity Workflow.
1907380	1911460	Here she can see at a glance activity metrics, such as the number of activities,
1911460	1915060	with metrics on average hours create to close in subject of the activity.
1915860	1921940	Here is a breakdown of activities by assigned user. Explore also features several policy reports,
1921940	1925860	grouped under two categories, underwriting conversion and underwriting efficiency.
1930100	1934260	The active submissions dashboard presents an analysis of open submissions.
1934260	1939220	The horizontal toolbar along the top consists of dynamic filters that enable users to update
1939220	1944740	the display by effective date, company, line of business, and product. A filter can also be added
1944740	1953780	to bring in criteria from the product model. Let us take a brief look at underwriting efficiency.
1958660	1963620	Here you can see there are 218 underwriting issues with an average of two days to close.
1963620	1968660	The chart on the right shows underwriting issues by type. Maybe Sonya has a particular
1968660	1972340	underwriting issue that is being flagged significantly more often than the rest,
1972340	1975700	causing a processing bottleneck for the straight through processing workflow.
1976260	1979780	Sonya can see in near real time, the issue that is causing the bottleneck.
1980340	1983540	Scrolling down, we see the underwriting issues search report.
1987860	1993060	And above the search list is a reminder that Sonya can export the data in raw or CSV format.
1995300	1997860	She can also create ad hoc operational reports.
2002820	2006660	In this demonstration, Sonya Weber and Insurance Manager gave you a
2006660	2010980	brief tour of Guidewire Live Analytics. You learned how to explore Stream's data
2010980	2015780	from Insurance suite databases and provides near real-time insights that enable smart business
2015780	2021140	decisions. In this demonstration, Sonya Weber and Insurance Manager gave you a
2021140	2025300	brief tour of Guidewire Live Analytics. You learned how to explore Stream's data
2025300	2030180	from Insurance suite databases and provides near real-time insights that enable smart business
2030180	2034880	decisions.
2034880	2037980	You have completed the course, Guidewire Cloud Overview.
2037980	2044100	You should now be able to describe the Guidewire Cloud applications, producer engage, policy
2044100	2048700	center, customer engage, claim center, and explorer.
2048700	2053620	Also, you should be able to explain how Guidewire Cloud applications help insurers meet these
2053620	2057940	three essential imperatives, engage customers, innovate, and grow efficiently.
