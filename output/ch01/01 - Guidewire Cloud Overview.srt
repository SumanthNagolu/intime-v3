1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,160
Welcome to an overview of Guidewire Cloud.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,760
By completing this lesson, you will be able to describe the Guidewire Cloud Applications,

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,880
Producer Engage, Policy Center, Customer Engage, Claim Center, and Explorer.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,640
Also, you will be able to explain how Guidewire Cloud Applications help insurers meet three

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:35,640
essential imperatives, engage customers, innovate, and grow efficiently.

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,160
Guidewire is the platform P&C insurers trust to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently.

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,440
We combine digital, core, analytics, and AI to deliver insurance suite as a cloud service.

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,480
Insurers want to be able to engage, provide an innovative experience for their customers,

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,360
and ultimately make insurance convenient.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,080
Insurers want to innovate and to rapidly prototype and deploy products faster than ever before.

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,360
And, insurers want to be able to grow efficiently, reducing IT complexity and ultimately driving

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,120
process improvement.

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,640
This course takes you on a tour of insurance suite for the cloud.

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,480
We focus on five personas, the broker or agent, the customer service representative or underwriter,

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,320
the policyholder, the claims adjuster, and then finally the insurance manager.

16
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,480
As we walk you through the policy lifecycle, you will see those strategic imperatives come

17
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
to light.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,720
How to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently through the seamless integration of Guidewire

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,160
Insurance Suite, and straight through processing.

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,400
The first stop on our tour is Producer Engage.

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,640
Producer Engage is the agent-facing part of the Guidewire Cloud Platform.

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
This digital application supports end-to-end business transactions that are important to

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,760
an agent.

24
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,680
Through Producer Engage, agents have access to policy, billing, and claims information

25
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,040
as well as relevant tasks and activities, on a single screen.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,320
Producer Engage is seamlessly integrated with Guidewire Insurance Suite for a 360-degree

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,880
view.

28
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,640
Producer Engage enables an agent to find a suitable insurance quote for a customer, complete

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:21,360
a quote, change or cancel a policy, and submit a claim on a client's behalf.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,160
For our tour of Producer Engage, Archie Armstrong, an agent, will demonstrate how straight through

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,560
processing streamlines every aspect of his job.

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,200
Our demonstration begins with our agent, Archie Armstrong, logging into Producer Engage.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,480
Archie is immediately presented with a Producer Engage dashboard, where he can see at a glance

34
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,460
everything that requires his attention today.

35
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,920
Across the top, a row of dynamic tiles provides quick access to open quotes, endorsements,

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,640
open cancellations, and renewals.

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,360
Listed below the tiles are all open activities that are assigned to Archie and are due within

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,280
the next seven days.

39
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,040
Each activity can be expanded to show its details.

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,800
Activities are actionable items that an agent can work on any time.

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,480
Activity details include the escalation date as well as the activity type and a brief description.

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,760
Currently, there are no activity notes, but Archie could add a note.

43
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,360
After Archie has completed this activity, he marks it as complete.

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,200
A hyperlink provides access to the related policy.

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,860
Notice the panel on the right.

46
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,240
This demonstrates the ability to access and display information from outside data sources

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,560
such as Twitter on the Producer Engage dashboard.

48
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,880
This dashboard, and in fact, all of Producer Engage, is a configurable framework.

49
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,640
The expectation is that customers will want to lightly configure the application for their

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,320
particular requirements and introduce their unique look and feel.

51
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,440
The tabs across the top of the screen enable an agent to access any account and to search

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,200
for a specific account.

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,240
The tiles are built-in filters.

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,400
You can filter on recently viewed, recently created, personal accounts, and commercial

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,560
accounts.

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
In the recently viewed area, hyperlinks provide the means to navigate quickly to an account.

57
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,920
Notice there are tabs to access policies and claims.

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,600
Producer Engage is seamlessly integrated with Policy Center and Claim Center.

59
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,200
There is also a tab for viewing activities.

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,040
Now that you have had a brief tour of Producer Engage, let us go to the Write Construction

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,160
account.

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,240
Here is the account summary screen for Write Construction.

63
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,480
This screen provides an agent with a 360-degree view of one account.

64
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,040
The screen exposes relevant policies, claims, and billing data, again demonstrating the seamless

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
integration between Guidewire Insurance Suite products.

66
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,720
You can see summary details that are drawn from Policy Center.

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,880
Producer information includes billing details from Billing Center.

68
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,920
The Claims tile provides access to data in Claim Center.

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:03,480
The Contacts tile accesses all contacts that are associated with this account.

70
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,520
Let us click Open Activities.

71
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,600
Here is a list of all open activities related to Write Construction with a button for creating

72
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,080
a new activity.

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,920
An agent can view open quotes, open endorsements and transactions in general, and any claims

74
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,640
associated with the account.

75
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,640
The Billing and Payment tile provides access to billing information for the account.

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,040
Here, you can set up automatic payments and manually make payments.

77
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,360
Notice the Billing Health check for the account.

78
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,180
Let us return to the summary screen where our Producer can start a new quote.

79
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,320
To initiate a new quote for Write Construction, Archie would start by clicking New Quote for

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
this account.

81
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,520
Suppose, however, another customer calls while he is viewing the Write Construction account.

82
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,280
Archie can simply click Start New Quote, and he will be prompted to start a quote for any

83
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,760
account.

84
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,080
Archie clicks New Quote for this account to start the submission workflow.

85
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,960
First, he selects his Producer Code.

86
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,160
The Producer Code restricts the products that a given agent can sell.

87
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:09,480
Archie chooses a commercial property submission for this example.

88
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:17,600
This is a function of the submission workflow, which is designed to be streamlined and intuitive,

89
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,680
reducing potential customer frustration and redundancy and minimizing the potential for

90
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,840
error.

91
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,120
After Archie clicks Next, the submission work tree is displayed on the left side, showing

92
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,360
the steps of the wizard-driven workflow.

93
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,440
The next step is to add buildings and locations to the submission.

94
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,360
An agent could capture buildings and locations by adding each one manually.

95
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,720
However, Archie chooses to upload an SOV, statement of values, by means of an Excel spreadsheet.

96
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,560
To get started with uploading spreadsheets, you must download the pre-formatted template

97
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,760
first.

98
00:06:51,760 --> 00:07:00,320
Archie selects an SOV that was created earlier.

99
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,600
In a matter of seconds, nine buildings have been imported into Producer Engage.

100
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,480
As you can imagine, this facility is a real-time saver.

101
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,720
Customers working with legacy systems typically need to manually key in all information concerning

102
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,680
buildings and locations.

103
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,160
This task can take hours to accomplish.

104
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,560
The ability to import effortlessly these nine buildings and feed the data into the workflow

105
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,440
significantly streamlines the operation.

106
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,400
Archie chooses building number one for the main office.

107
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,920
Let us take a look at everything that was captured with a click of a button.

108
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,880
Here is the full address with the territory code, the building number, and the property

109
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,160
class code.

110
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,360
All of the coverages have been defaulted based on guidewire offerings, which are essentially

111
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,680
packages of coverages and limits for specific risks.

112
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,360
By using default values for all the coverages, the workflow provides a straight-through, low-touch

113
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,440
underwriting environment.

114
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,520
Of course, Archie can choose to modify the coverages, but the more he deviates from the

115
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,160
defaulted values, the more data he will need to provide.

116
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,720
And the less streamlined the quote cost becomes.

117
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,120
Let us scroll through the coverages.

118
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,560
You can see the building coverage, the business personal property coverage, the business income

119
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,400
coverage, and extra expense coverage as well.

120
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,440
Archie can edit any of these coverages.

121
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,640
However, he decides to accept all the defaults.

122
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,320
He returns to the buildings and locations screen and clicks next.

123
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,040
Now that all nine buildings with limits and coverages have been captured, the workflow

124
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,800
sends the information over to the rating engine.

125
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,480
In the process, any business, underwriting, and reinsurance rules are run against risks

126
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,080
before the rating engine returns the total cost of the quote.

127
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,300
In a matter of minutes, Archie has gone from submission to quoted on a nine-schedule commercial

128
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,800
property quote.

129
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,320
That is impressive.

130
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,520
Archie clicks next and scans the policy information to be sure it is correct.

131
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,200
Notice the email and phone data has been populated with information that was stored with the

132
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,880
account.

133
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,260
The payment details screen is next.

134
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,280
This screen is populated with information drawn from billing center, which includes payment

135
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,700
details and a list of pay plans.

136
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,040
As a side note, guide wire can handle any type of pay plan.

137
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,720
These are created in billing center and exposed on the digital layer.

138
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:21,360
Archie selects the first plan in the list with 10% down payment and monthly installments.

139
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:30,440
In the payment options area, Archie enters the payment details and clicks buy now to

140
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,440
kick off the process of binding and issuing the policy.

141
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,320
The payment has been successful.

142
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,620
A unique policy number has been attached to the policy.

143
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:48,120
This number is hyperlinked in case the agent wants to view or edit the policy data.

144
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,260
If Archie needs to make a change, he can do so here.

145
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,660
He can renew or cancel the policy.

146
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,940
He can also populate the declaration page and print and send the ID cards.

147
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,220
The screen provides all this capability, some of which can also be automated.

148
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:11,140
Here is the transaction for the new policy with a premium of $29,934.

149
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,900
In this example, you saw how quickly an agent can bind and issue a policy using guide wire

150
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,980
straight through processing workflow capabilities.

151
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,060
Now let us see what happens when an underwriting rule interrupts the process of a new commercial

152
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,780
property submission.

153
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,740
Let us return to the right construction account, where the new policy is listed under issued

154
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,740
policies.

155
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:43,620
As in the earlier demonstration, Archie starts a new commercial property submission.

156
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:55,140
He finds and selects the SOV file to upload the spreadsheet.

157
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,220
And here are the nine buildings.

158
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,240
For the purposes of this example, we have created an underwriting rule that raises an

159
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:10,140
underwriting issue for any building that was constructed earlier than 1990.

160
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,700
Archie opens the main office building number one location to edit the building details.

161
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:22,380
He types 1984 for the year built and saves the changes.

162
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:28,060
Then he continues with the same workflow that you saw earlier.

163
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,820
Again, the workflow sends a submission to the rating engine, which returns the total

164
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,340
cost of the quote.

165
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,100
The underwriting rule could have fired now, when the rating engine returns the premium

166
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
amount.

167
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,180
However, the rule was designed to fire after Archie selects a pay plan for the policy.

168
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:54,620
This means all the data will have been captured before the underwriting referral occurs.

169
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:07,540
Archie enters payment information and clicks buy now.

170
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,820
The underwriting rule fires and returns an error, as we expected.

171
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,500
Archie clicks OK.

172
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,220
An alert on the quote screen informs the agent that underwriting issues have been raised

173
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,500
for this quote.

174
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,900
The issue listed under underwriting issues is building older than 1990, which has blocked

175
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,180
the bind.

176
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,140
Archie decides to refer the issue to the underwriter.

177
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:36,780
First, he adds a brief note that tells the underwriter it is part of a larger account

178
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,380
that is clean account.

179
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:48,380
See main office number one.

180
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:51,900
He clicks confirm.

181
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,300
The quote has been referred to the assigned underwriter for review.

182
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,900
An activity has been created for the underwriter review and approval.

183
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,780
Immediately, Archie sees the new activity, review and approve for commercial property

184
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,820
for right construction assigned to Christine Kraft, the underwriter.

185
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:19,460
The activity was created by Archie Armstrong with a note for Christine Kraft.

186
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:25,220
The next stop on our tour of insurance suite for the cloud is policy center.

187
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,100
Policy center provides full end to end policy management and issuance functionality including

188
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,300
quoting, rating, underwriting, policy generation, and statistical reporting.

189
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,260
It offers seamless integration between core functionality and predictive analytics.

190
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,460
Policy center enables agents and underwriters to create and manage policies, handle inquiries

191
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:53,780
and service accounts, evaluate risks, view policies, create activities.

192
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:59,860
Policy center brings efficiency to every step from submission to renewal.

193
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,780
In the previous demonstration, we met Archie Armstrong, an agent who created two submissions

194
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,660
using producer engage.

195
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,060
The second submission raised an underwriting issue because of an older building.

196
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,260
In this next demonstration, we meet Christine Kraft, the underwriter who was assigned at

197
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,340
the issue.

198
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,780
Christine Kraft begins by logging into policy center.

199
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,900
Policy center is a role based application, which means everything from screen flow to

200
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,220
access to data is based on permissions granted to Christine's role as an underwriter.

201
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,860
The summary screen is Christine's desktop.

202
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,220
As you can see, the desktop is designed for ease of use.

203
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,300
All the data that is pertinent to Christine's role is either displayed on the screen or is

204
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,500
available at the click of a button.

205
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,140
Here is the review and approve activity for right construction that was just sent from

206
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,180
producer engage.

207
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,940
Before Christine opens the activity, let us take a few minutes to take a brief tour of

208
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,300
policy center.

209
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,940
I have already mentioned the intuitive design of the summary screen.

210
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,380
Like producer engage, policy center is a framework that is intended to be lightly configured

211
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,140
by each customer.

212
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,700
The sidebar on the left contains the actions menu at the top.

213
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,100
This menu is dynamic.

214
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,820
The available menu options vary based on the current context and the role of the user.

215
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:23,300
For example, from the summary screen, Christine can create a new submission or a new account.

216
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,900
In addition, the sidebar provides menu links for quick access to the summary screen to

217
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,100
activities, submissions, renewals, and so on.

218
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,660
Across the top are tabs for accessing accounts, policies, contacts, and search.

219
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,700
Christine can search by account number.

220
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,220
She can select new account or, on the policy tab, start a new submission.

221
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,140
Policy center has sophisticated search functionality.

222
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,780
The built-in search uses solid platform capability, which provides features such as sounds like

223
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,620
and fuzzy search.

224
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,540
The options available on the administration tab are based on Christine's role and permissions.

225
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,860
Users and security gives her access to users, organizations, producer codes, and so on.

226
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:13,180
Now, let us look at the right construction account.

227
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,300
Christine clicks the link to the account holder summary dashboard.

228
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,060
An account holder is the primary contact associated with an account.

229
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,780
This screen provides a complete 360-degree picture of the customer relationship and current

230
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:28,980
interactions by displaying data across all accounts for which the contact is the account

231
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
holder.

232
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,980
The account holder summary is especially useful for customer service representatives.

233
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,500
Notice the billing and claims health check on the right-hand side of the screen.

234
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:44,580
Below are the policies owned by right construction, any open policy transactions, and open claims.

235
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,780
Christine can access the details for a policy or claim by clicking the hyperlink reference

236
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,780
number.

237
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,540
Again, thanks to seamless integration of insurance suite, she can view policy, claim, and billing

238
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,780
data all on the same screen.

239
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,420
Christine scrolls back to the top and clicks the link to the account summary for right

240
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:07,620
construction.

241
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:13,380
The overview area provides the ability to recalculate the three-year premium, loss ratio, and total

242
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,380
losses.

243
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:21,580
Below that is the billing health check.

244
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,740
Here is a list of current activities, then then a list of enforced policies.

245
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,780
Christine clicks the first policy number to view the latest policy for right construction.

246
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,340
The policy summary screen focuses on a single policy and provides the ability to calculate

247
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:42,820
the term financials at the policy level.

248
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,900
On the my summary screen, Christine examines the recent activity that was sent over by

249
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,740
Archie Armstrong, our agent.

250
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,100
The activity detail indicates this is a review and approve activity.

251
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,300
Christine clicks view notes for details.

252
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,020
She sees that this is part of a larger account, which is a clean account.

253
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,340
See the main office first location.

254
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,180
She puts the submission in edit mode, in case she needs to make any changes.

255
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,060
Notice this editable submission has a similar format to the wizard driven workflow that you

256
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,740
saw in producer engage.

257
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,180
However, as an internal user with the role of underwriter, Christine has more access

258
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,380
than agents have when using producer engage.

259
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,620
Christine clicks buildings and locations.

260
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,220
She knows to look specifically at main office building number one.

261
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,380
She notes that the year built is 1984, as Archie entered it.

262
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,700
Christine realizes the age of the building should not be a problem because the account

263
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,820
is clean, and this is only one of several buildings.

264
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:45,540
This screen provides the same import or export capability that Archie used in producer engage.

265
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,300
From here, Christine can proceed to rate the risk.

266
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,340
She is routed to the quote screen, where you can see the total cost broken out by total

267
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,100
premium and taxes and surcharges.

268
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,300
There are also two errors displayed in red.

269
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,940
The first error states, this policy has one or more outstanding contingencies.

270
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,060
The second error says, this quote will require underwriting approval prior to binding.

271
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,740
These messages proactively let the underwriter know that there are some items that need to

272
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,780
be taken care of before the policy can be issued.

273
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,700
If Christine tries to finish quote, the pre quote issues screen lists the issues that

274
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,460
are blocking the quote.

275
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,860
Christine's next step is to go to the risk analysis tab and approve the issues that

276
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,700
are blocking bind.

277
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,860
She clicks the risk analysis tab.

278
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,420
The underwriting issues tab is where Christine can view the issues that are blocking the

279
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,940
quote and either approve them and continue on with the workflow or reject them.

280
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:45,020
If she approves the issue, she can then bind and issue the policy.

281
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,500
Let us look at the predictive analytics tab.

282
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,460
The data on this screen illustrates the capability of guidewire predictive analytics.

283
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,100
Embedded data and analytics ensure that you know what's working, what's not, and what

284
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
to do next.

285
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,580
Currently, you see data based on pre-built models that are embedded into the workflow.

286
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,900
These represent one approach to predictive analytics.

287
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,940
Guidewire also supports a BYOM or bring your own models approach by enabling deployment,

288
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,020
integration, and monitoring of predictive models created using third party tools.

289
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,900
This dashboard shows an example of the risk models that we provide.

290
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,580
Profitability, customer retention, and expense reduction.

291
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,980
These analytics can be used as suggestions or they can provide input for automation,

292
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,420
which is the case for the inspection contingency workflow.

293
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,380
Here you can see that a contingency has automatically been attached to the policy based on these

294
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:43,060
predictive analytics.

295
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,500
In the demonstration, the predictive analytics dashboard showed an example of how real-time

296
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,540
predictive insights are embedded in guidewire core systems.

297
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,220
Predictive analytics involves building models to predict future results.

298
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,340
It provides guidance to frontline decision makers while continuously measuring business

299
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
value.

300
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,980
Predictive analytics for profitability helps by improving rating sophistication and granularity

301
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,220
while identifying and addressing pricing inaccuracies.

302
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,220
It improves underwriting profitability.

303
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,700
Predictive analytics for claims helps better manage claim indemnity and loss adjustment

304
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,420
expenses.

305
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,540
In this section, Christine Kraft, an underwriter, took us on a brief tour of policy center,

306
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,700
where she handled an underwriting issue.

307
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,940
We also visited the predictive analytics dashboard and viewed a contingency that was automatically

308
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,740
attached to the policy based on these predictive analytics.

309
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,500
The next tour stop is, customer engage account management.

310
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,900
Customer engage account management is a digital, self-service application that enables customers

311
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,740
to view and manage every aspect of their insurance account.

312
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,140
Customers have clear visibility into claim handling processes and operations.

313
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,540
Customer engage enriches the overall claims experience for policy holders.

314
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,100
Thanks to seamless integration with policy center, claim center, and billing center,

315
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,980
customers can view their invoices, policies, and claims, manage bills, make payments, and

316
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,140
manage payment schedules.

317
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:13,140
As you will see in our demonstration, a customer can file a claim and update personal information.

318
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,180
In the previous demonstrations, we have looked at the policy life cycle from the viewpoint

319
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,700
of an agent and then an underwriter.

320
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,780
In this next demonstration, we will switch to the customer perspective as we take a tour

321
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,020
of customer engage account management.

322
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,180
Meet Ben Wright, a customer who needs to file a claim.

323
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,820
Ben Wright of Wright Construction begins by logging into customer engage account management.

324
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:44,020
Wright Construction is the same account we have been working with in the previous demonstrations.

325
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,820
Ben's home page is the account summary screen.

326
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,420
This screen was designed to answer the main questions that customers have when they call

327
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,820
a customer service representative.

328
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,260
What is my balance?

329
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,860
Is anything past due?

330
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,780
If so, can I pay it?

331
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,620
And when is my next bill?

332
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,940
Answers to these questions are clearly displayed across the top of Ben's home screen.

333
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,820
Ben can also see all policies held by his account.

334
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,700
The account summary screen is another example of the seamless integration of policy, claims,

335
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,900
and billing functionality.

336
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,140
From this application, Ben can file a first notice of loss for a claim.

337
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,340
He can purchase insurance.

338
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,820
He can make payments.

339
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,900
On the billing summary, Ben can view the billing and payment details for each of the

340
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,740
Wright Construction policies.

341
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,380
He can also make a payment or set up automatic payments.

342
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,260
Similarly, the claims tab provides a list of hyperlinked claim numbers for claims

343
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,580
filed by Wright Construction with the status of each claim and the number of the related policy.

344
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,060
Ben returns to his home screen and locates the most recent policy.

345
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,020
He clicks, file a claim to start a first notice of loss.

346
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:57,220
Guidewire empowers insurers, placing billing, policy, and claims functionality at their fingertips.

347
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,940
Here is the new claim tab.

348
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,300
Notice the loss date is pre-filled with today's date, and the policy number is pre-selected.

349
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,700
After Ben clicks next, the claim information work tree is displayed on the left side,

350
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,340
showing the steps of this wizard-driven workflow.

351
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,500
The next step is for Ben to describe what happened, why he is filing a claim.

352
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,540
He selects the loss cause and enters the date of notice.

353
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,340
The important point here is not the details of this claim,

354
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,540
but the ease with which an insured is able to capture the claim details.

355
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Ben goes on to select the affected building.

356
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,580
As anyone who has taken a first notice of loss will attest, this is a stressful situation.

357
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,780
Customer engage is designed to make this process as easy and painless as possible.

358
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,380
Ben has entered the claim details.

359
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,300
He selects the address from a list of addresses associated with his account.

360
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,260
In the next step, Ben will have the opportunity to upload any pictures or supporting documents.

361
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,780
If there are witnesses or other third parties, he can add them here.

362
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,500
Ben simply adds himself as a contact and clicks next.

363
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,700
The new claim summary provides Ben the opportunity to make sure the information

364
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,220
is correct and complete.

365
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,820
And he is ready to submit the claim.

366
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,820
The claim has been successfully submitted.

367
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,220
A unique claim number has been attached to the claim.

368
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,300
Behind the scenes, the workflow has automatically triaged the claim

369
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,660
and assigned it to a claims adjuster based on the characteristics of the claim.

370
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,220
Productivity is improved by ensuring the right claim to assign to the right adjuster.

371
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,060
In this demonstration, Ben Wright, a policyholder,

372
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,100
filed a claim using customer engage account management.

373
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,300
In the next section, the adjuster who was assigned to the new claim

374
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,980
will examine the claim and claim center.

375
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,460
Next stop on the tour, claim center and the guidewire cloud platform.

376
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,820
Guidewire claim center is the PNC industry's most trusted claims management solution.

377
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,580
Claim center manages the entire claims process from first notice of loss

378
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,740
through a execution of financial transactions.

379
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,940
With claim center, your claims teams have real time access to the information they need

380
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,060
when they need it.

381
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,980
When Scott logs into claim center, he also has instant access to relevant

382
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,140
information stored in policy center, billing center, and contact manager

383
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,020
thanks to the seamless integration of all insurance suite products.

384
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,380
Claim center enables claims automation to free up your resources to focus on complex

385
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,580
claims and easily defines when and how exposures, reserves and activities are created.

386
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,820
Claim center ensures compliance with corporate policies and claims best practices

387
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,020
throughout your organization.

388
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,780
In the previous demonstration, we met Ben Wright,

389
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,940
a policyholder who filed a claim using customer engage account management.

390
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,860
Based on the claim characteristics, automated workflow has assigned Ben's first

391
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,340
notice of loss to Scott Henson, a claims adjuster.

392
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,740
In this next demonstration, the persona of Scott, a claim adjuster,

393
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,500
will view the new claim and claim center.

394
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,260
Scott logs into claim center.

395
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,540
Like policy center, claim center is a role based application.

396
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,180
Everything that follows from screen flow to data access is based on Scott's role as a

397
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,060
claims adjuster.

398
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,020
Scott immediately sees two activities on his summary screen that are related to the first

399
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,180
notice of loss that Ben filed just minutes ago from customer engage account management.

400
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,460
Before Scott addresses the new claim, let us take a few minutes for a brief tour of claim center.

401
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,740
As in policy center, the actions menu and claims center is dynamic, varying the menu options that

402
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,340
are available to Scott based on his permissions and on the current context.

403
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,740
The sidebar provides additional menu links for quick access to activities,

404
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,980
claims, exposures, subrogations, pending adjustments, and so on.

405
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,580
Across the top in the tab bar, Scott can start a first notice of loss or search for a claim.

406
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,380
The team tab, which is available to Scott,

407
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,580
the team tab, which is available to managers and supervisors, provides a visual management

408
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,580
tool for managing groups that Scott supervises and any subgroups of those groups.

409
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,660
At this point, Scott clicks the claim number to examine the new claim.

410
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,460
Of course, since this is a new claim, there is not much detail yet.

411
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,300
The summary screen provides an overview of how the claim is performing.

412
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,100
In the basics area, you see the associated target,

413
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,140
which is calculated by a rule and is specific to the insurer.

414
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,140
If there were a potential large loss associated with the loss,

415
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,700
a high risk indicator would be displayed in the top right.

416
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,980
Currently, no exposures are listed for the claim.

417
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,620
Guidewire provides an automated exposure and reserve creation capability.

418
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,580
Services attached to the claim would be listed here.

419
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,980
Scott views the planned activities, which are based on business logic and are part of the claims tree.

420
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:05,060
Notice the health metrics tab, which shows several health metrics that have been run

421
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,340
against the claim and indicate how efficiently the claim is being processed.

422
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,140
The policy tab gives Scott a view into the policy related to the claim.

423
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,420
He can see the locations, coverages, and limits without having to switch back and forth between

424
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,940
claim center and policy center.

425
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,380
Claim financials are available on the financials tab.

426
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,980
Of course, for a new claim, there is not much to show yet.

427
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,860
Starting with the first demonstration and ending with this demonstration in claim center,

428
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,340
you have now walked through a day in the life of a policy.

429
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,180
The final stop on our tour of Guidewire Cloud is Explore.

430
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,980
You will see what Guidewire provides from a business intelligence and operational reporting standpoint.

431
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,020
Explore is a cloud-native data analytics and visualization application that enables you to

432
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,300
explore data from your Guidewire insurance suite applications.

433
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,460
Each Explore dashboard includes several visualizations that represent your data.

434
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,180
With Explore, you can analyze your data to discover new insights, visualize and collaborate

435
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,180
to improve business effectiveness, accelerate decision-making,

436
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,300
Explore streams data from core systems and other sources into a scalable data infrastructure to

437
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,900
provide near real-time insights and enable smart business decisions.

438
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,700
For our final demonstration, Sonya Weber, an insurance manager, will take you on a tour of

439
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,540
Guidewire Live Analytics and Explore.

440
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:38,340
Explore is a cloud-only service that provides 10 pre-built operational dashboards,

441
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:45,300
which provide valuable near-real-time insights into claim and policy performance.

442
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,980
As an insurance manager, Sonya needs up-to-the-minute feedback on how claims are performing.

443
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,940
The first tab Sonya sees is Claim Center Open Inventory Management, which provides an operational

444
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:00,980
overview of how the claim process is performing. The dashboard is fed in near-real-time from our

445
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,980
data lake based on claims, and can be used to optimize your claims operations.

446
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,020
Sonya sees there are currently 207 open claims, with a total incurred of more than

447
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,660
three and a half million dollars. She looks over to the right to view various claim metrics,

448
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:19,620
such as open claims by segment and open claims by assigned group. In the lower left,

449
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,140
is claim volume by user which is ordered by overdue activities. These, and other metrics,

450
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,580
help Sonya optimize her everyday claims management. An important feature of Explore is the ability to

451
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,340
export the data from any of the dashboards in raw or CSV format. Sonya can easily send the charts

452
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,220
and figures displayed on her dashboard to a downstream reporting system. Another dashboard

453
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,300
that aids Sonya in assessing claim performance is the Claim Center Activity Workflow.

454
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,460
Here she can see at a glance activity metrics, such as the number of activities,

455
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:55,060
with metrics on average hours create to close in subject of the activity.

456
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,940
Here is a breakdown of activities by assigned user. Explore also features several policy reports,

457
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,860
grouped under two categories, underwriting conversion and underwriting efficiency.

458
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,260
The active submissions dashboard presents an analysis of open submissions.

459
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,220
The horizontal toolbar along the top consists of dynamic filters that enable users to update

460
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,740
the display by effective date, company, line of business, and product. A filter can also be added

461
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:33,780
to bring in criteria from the product model. Let us take a brief look at underwriting efficiency.

462
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:43,620
Here you can see there are 218 underwriting issues with an average of two days to close.

463
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:48,660
The chart on the right shows underwriting issues by type. Maybe Sonya has a particular

464
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,340
underwriting issue that is being flagged significantly more often than the rest,

465
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,700
causing a processing bottleneck for the straight through processing workflow.

466
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,780
Sonya can see in near real time, the issue that is causing the bottleneck.

467
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,540
Scrolling down, we see the underwriting issues search report.

468
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:13,060
And above the search list is a reminder that Sonya can export the data in raw or CSV format.

469
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,860
She can also create ad hoc operational reports.

470
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,660
In this demonstration, Sonya Weber and Insurance Manager gave you a

471
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:30,980
brief tour of Guidewire Live Analytics. You learned how to explore Stream's data

472
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,780
from Insurance suite databases and provides near real-time insights that enable smart business

473
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:41,140
decisions. In this demonstration, Sonya Weber and Insurance Manager gave you a

474
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,300
brief tour of Guidewire Live Analytics. You learned how to explore Stream's data

475
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:50,180
from Insurance suite databases and provides near real-time insights that enable smart business

476
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,880
decisions.

477
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,980
You have completed the course, Guidewire Cloud Overview.

478
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:04,100
You should now be able to describe the Guidewire Cloud applications, producer engage, policy

479
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,700
center, customer engage, claim center, and explorer.

480
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:13,620
Also, you should be able to explain how Guidewire Cloud applications help insurers meet these

481
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,940
three essential imperatives, engage customers, innovate, and grow efficiently.
