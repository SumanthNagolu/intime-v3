00:00.000 --> 00:11.160
Welcome to an overview of Guidewire Cloud.

00:11.160 --> 00:16.760
By completing this lesson, you will be able to describe the Guidewire Cloud Applications,

00:16.760 --> 00:21.880
Producer Engage, Policy Center, Customer Engage, Claim Center, and Explorer.

00:21.880 --> 00:26.640
Also, you will be able to explain how Guidewire Cloud Applications help insurers meet three

00:26.640 --> 00:35.640
essential imperatives, engage customers, innovate, and grow efficiently.

00:35.640 --> 00:41.160
Guidewire is the platform P&C insurers trust to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently.

00:41.160 --> 00:47.440
We combine digital, core, analytics, and AI to deliver insurance suite as a cloud service.

00:47.440 --> 00:51.480
Insurers want to be able to engage, provide an innovative experience for their customers,

00:51.480 --> 00:54.360
and ultimately make insurance convenient.

00:54.360 --> 00:59.080
Insurers want to innovate and to rapidly prototype and deploy products faster than ever before.

00:59.080 --> 01:04.360
And, insurers want to be able to grow efficiently, reducing IT complexity and ultimately driving

01:04.360 --> 01:09.120
process improvement.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.640
This course takes you on a tour of insurance suite for the cloud.

01:12.640 --> 01:18.480
We focus on five personas, the broker or agent, the customer service representative or underwriter,

01:18.480 --> 01:23.320
the policyholder, the claims adjuster, and then finally the insurance manager.

01:23.320 --> 01:27.480
As we walk you through the policy lifecycle, you will see those strategic imperatives come

01:27.480 --> 01:28.480
to light.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.720
How to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently through the seamless integration of Guidewire

01:32.720 --> 01:37.160
Insurance Suite, and straight through processing.

01:37.160 --> 01:42.400
The first stop on our tour is Producer Engage.

01:42.400 --> 01:46.640
Producer Engage is the agent-facing part of the Guidewire Cloud Platform.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.560
This digital application supports end-to-end business transactions that are important to

01:50.560 --> 01:51.760
an agent.

01:51.760 --> 01:56.680
Through Producer Engage, agents have access to policy, billing, and claims information

01:56.680 --> 02:01.040
as well as relevant tasks and activities, on a single screen.

02:01.040 --> 02:05.320
Producer Engage is seamlessly integrated with Guidewire Insurance Suite for a 360-degree

02:05.320 --> 02:06.880
view.

02:06.880 --> 02:12.640
Producer Engage enables an agent to find a suitable insurance quote for a customer, complete

02:12.640 --> 02:21.360
a quote, change or cancel a policy, and submit a claim on a client's behalf.

02:21.360 --> 02:26.160
For our tour of Producer Engage, Archie Armstrong, an agent, will demonstrate how straight through

02:26.160 --> 02:31.560
processing streamlines every aspect of his job.

02:31.560 --> 02:37.200
Our demonstration begins with our agent, Archie Armstrong, logging into Producer Engage.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.480
Archie is immediately presented with a Producer Engage dashboard, where he can see at a glance

02:41.480 --> 02:44.460
everything that requires his attention today.

02:44.460 --> 02:49.920
Across the top, a row of dynamic tiles provides quick access to open quotes, endorsements,

02:49.920 --> 02:53.640
open cancellations, and renewals.

02:53.640 --> 02:57.360
Listed below the tiles are all open activities that are assigned to Archie and are due within

02:57.360 --> 02:59.280
the next seven days.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.040
Each activity can be expanded to show its details.

03:03.040 --> 03:06.800
Activities are actionable items that an agent can work on any time.

03:06.800 --> 03:11.480
Activity details include the escalation date as well as the activity type and a brief description.

03:11.480 --> 03:17.760
Currently, there are no activity notes, but Archie could add a note.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.360
After Archie has completed this activity, he marks it as complete.

03:21.360 --> 03:27.200
A hyperlink provides access to the related policy.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.860
Notice the panel on the right.

03:28.860 --> 03:33.240
This demonstrates the ability to access and display information from outside data sources

03:33.240 --> 03:36.560
such as Twitter on the Producer Engage dashboard.

03:36.560 --> 03:41.880
This dashboard, and in fact, all of Producer Engage, is a configurable framework.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.640
The expectation is that customers will want to lightly configure the application for their

03:45.640 --> 03:51.320
particular requirements and introduce their unique look and feel.

03:51.320 --> 03:55.440
The tabs across the top of the screen enable an agent to access any account and to search

03:55.440 --> 03:57.200
for a specific account.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.240
The tiles are built-in filters.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.400
You can filter on recently viewed, recently created, personal accounts, and commercial

04:03.400 --> 04:04.560
accounts.

04:04.560 --> 04:09.680
In the recently viewed area, hyperlinks provide the means to navigate quickly to an account.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.920
Notice there are tabs to access policies and claims.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.600
Producer Engage is seamlessly integrated with Policy Center and Claim Center.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.200
There is also a tab for viewing activities.

04:20.200 --> 04:24.040
Now that you have had a brief tour of Producer Engage, let us go to the Write Construction

04:24.040 --> 04:26.160
account.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.240
Here is the account summary screen for Write Construction.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.480
This screen provides an agent with a 360-degree view of one account.

04:33.480 --> 04:39.040
The screen exposes relevant policies, claims, and billing data, again demonstrating the seamless

04:39.040 --> 04:42.400
integration between Guidewire Insurance Suite products.

04:42.400 --> 04:46.720
You can see summary details that are drawn from Policy Center.

04:46.720 --> 04:51.880
Producer information includes billing details from Billing Center.

04:51.880 --> 04:56.920
The Claims tile provides access to data in Claim Center.

04:56.920 --> 05:03.480
The Contacts tile accesses all contacts that are associated with this account.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.520
Let us click Open Activities.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.600
Here is a list of all open activities related to Write Construction with a button for creating

05:09.600 --> 05:11.080
a new activity.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.920
An agent can view open quotes, open endorsements and transactions in general, and any claims

05:15.920 --> 05:19.640
associated with the account.

05:19.640 --> 05:23.640
The Billing and Payment tile provides access to billing information for the account.

05:23.640 --> 05:28.040
Here, you can set up automatic payments and manually make payments.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.360
Notice the Billing Health check for the account.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.180
Let us return to the summary screen where our Producer can start a new quote.

05:35.180 --> 05:39.320
To initiate a new quote for Write Construction, Archie would start by clicking New Quote for

05:39.320 --> 05:40.320
this account.

05:40.560 --> 05:45.520
Suppose, however, another customer calls while he is viewing the Write Construction account.

05:45.520 --> 05:49.280
Archie can simply click Start New Quote, and he will be prompted to start a quote for any

05:49.280 --> 05:50.760
account.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.080
Archie clicks New Quote for this account to start the submission workflow.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.960
First, he selects his Producer Code.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.160
The Producer Code restricts the products that a given agent can sell.

06:01.160 --> 06:09.480
Archie chooses a commercial property submission for this example.

06:10.480 --> 06:17.600
This is a function of the submission workflow, which is designed to be streamlined and intuitive,

06:17.600 --> 06:21.680
reducing potential customer frustration and redundancy and minimizing the potential for

06:21.680 --> 06:23.840
error.

06:23.840 --> 06:28.120
After Archie clicks Next, the submission work tree is displayed on the left side, showing

06:28.120 --> 06:31.360
the steps of the wizard-driven workflow.

06:31.360 --> 06:35.440
The next step is to add buildings and locations to the submission.

06:35.440 --> 06:39.360
An agent could capture buildings and locations by adding each one manually.

06:39.360 --> 06:45.720
However, Archie chooses to upload an SOV, statement of values, by means of an Excel spreadsheet.

06:45.720 --> 06:49.560
To get started with uploading spreadsheets, you must download the pre-formatted template

06:49.560 --> 06:51.760
first.

06:51.760 --> 07:00.320
Archie selects an SOV that was created earlier.

07:00.320 --> 07:04.600
In a matter of seconds, nine buildings have been imported into Producer Engage.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.480
As you can imagine, this facility is a real-time saver.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.720
Customers working with legacy systems typically need to manually key in all information concerning

07:12.720 --> 07:14.680
buildings and locations.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.160
This task can take hours to accomplish.

07:17.160 --> 07:21.560
The ability to import effortlessly these nine buildings and feed the data into the workflow

07:21.560 --> 07:24.440
significantly streamlines the operation.

07:24.440 --> 07:28.400
Archie chooses building number one for the main office.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.920
Let us take a look at everything that was captured with a click of a button.

07:31.920 --> 07:35.880
Here is the full address with the territory code, the building number, and the property

07:35.880 --> 07:38.160
class code.

07:38.160 --> 07:42.360
All of the coverages have been defaulted based on guidewire offerings, which are essentially

07:42.360 --> 07:45.680
packages of coverages and limits for specific risks.

07:45.680 --> 07:50.360
By using default values for all the coverages, the workflow provides a straight-through, low-touch

07:50.360 --> 07:52.440
underwriting environment.

07:52.440 --> 07:56.520
Of course, Archie can choose to modify the coverages, but the more he deviates from the

07:56.520 --> 08:00.160
defaulted values, the more data he will need to provide.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.720
And the less streamlined the quote cost becomes.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.120
Let us scroll through the coverages.

08:06.120 --> 08:10.560
You can see the building coverage, the business personal property coverage, the business income

08:10.560 --> 08:15.400
coverage, and extra expense coverage as well.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.440
Archie can edit any of these coverages.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.640
However, he decides to accept all the defaults.

08:20.640 --> 08:26.320
He returns to the buildings and locations screen and clicks next.

08:26.320 --> 08:30.040
Now that all nine buildings with limits and coverages have been captured, the workflow

08:30.040 --> 08:32.800
sends the information over to the rating engine.

08:32.800 --> 08:37.480
In the process, any business, underwriting, and reinsurance rules are run against risks

08:37.480 --> 08:41.080
before the rating engine returns the total cost of the quote.

08:41.080 --> 08:45.300
In a matter of minutes, Archie has gone from submission to quoted on a nine-schedule commercial

08:45.300 --> 08:46.800
property quote.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.320
That is impressive.

08:48.320 --> 08:52.520
Archie clicks next and scans the policy information to be sure it is correct.

08:52.520 --> 08:56.200
Notice the email and phone data has been populated with information that was stored with the

08:56.200 --> 08:59.880
account.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.260
The payment details screen is next.

09:02.260 --> 09:06.280
This screen is populated with information drawn from billing center, which includes payment

09:06.280 --> 09:08.700
details and a list of pay plans.

09:08.700 --> 09:12.040
As a side note, guide wire can handle any type of pay plan.

09:12.040 --> 09:15.720
These are created in billing center and exposed on the digital layer.

09:15.720 --> 09:21.360
Archie selects the first plan in the list with 10% down payment and monthly installments.

09:21.360 --> 09:30.440
In the payment options area, Archie enters the payment details and clicks buy now to

09:30.440 --> 09:36.440
kick off the process of binding and issuing the policy.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.320
The payment has been successful.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.620
A unique policy number has been attached to the policy.

09:41.620 --> 09:48.120
This number is hyperlinked in case the agent wants to view or edit the policy data.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.260
If Archie needs to make a change, he can do so here.

09:52.260 --> 09:53.660
He can renew or cancel the policy.

09:53.660 --> 09:57.940
He can also populate the declaration page and print and send the ID cards.

09:57.940 --> 10:03.220
The screen provides all this capability, some of which can also be automated.

10:03.220 --> 10:11.140
Here is the transaction for the new policy with a premium of $29,934.

10:11.140 --> 10:15.900
In this example, you saw how quickly an agent can bind and issue a policy using guide wire

10:15.900 --> 10:18.980
straight through processing workflow capabilities.

10:18.980 --> 10:23.060
Now let us see what happens when an underwriting rule interrupts the process of a new commercial

10:23.060 --> 10:24.780
property submission.

10:24.780 --> 10:28.740
Let us return to the right construction account, where the new policy is listed under issued

10:28.740 --> 10:30.740
policies.

10:30.740 --> 10:43.620
As in the earlier demonstration, Archie starts a new commercial property submission.

10:43.620 --> 10:55.140
He finds and selects the SOV file to upload the spreadsheet.

10:55.140 --> 10:59.220
And here are the nine buildings.

10:59.220 --> 11:03.240
For the purposes of this example, we have created an underwriting rule that raises an

11:03.240 --> 11:10.140
underwriting issue for any building that was constructed earlier than 1990.

11:10.140 --> 11:14.700
Archie opens the main office building number one location to edit the building details.

11:14.700 --> 11:22.380
He types 1984 for the year built and saves the changes.

11:22.380 --> 11:28.060
Then he continues with the same workflow that you saw earlier.

11:28.060 --> 11:33.820
Again, the workflow sends a submission to the rating engine, which returns the total

11:33.820 --> 11:35.340
cost of the quote.

11:35.340 --> 11:39.100
The underwriting rule could have fired now, when the rating engine returns the premium

11:39.100 --> 11:40.100
amount.

11:40.100 --> 11:45.180
However, the rule was designed to fire after Archie selects a pay plan for the policy.

11:45.180 --> 11:54.620
This means all the data will have been captured before the underwriting referral occurs.

11:54.620 --> 12:07.540
Archie enters payment information and clicks buy now.

12:07.540 --> 12:12.820
The underwriting rule fires and returns an error, as we expected.

12:12.820 --> 12:14.500
Archie clicks OK.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.220
An alert on the quote screen informs the agent that underwriting issues have been raised

12:18.220 --> 12:19.500
for this quote.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.900
The issue listed under underwriting issues is building older than 1990, which has blocked

12:23.900 --> 12:27.180
the bind.

12:27.180 --> 12:31.140
Archie decides to refer the issue to the underwriter.

12:31.140 --> 12:36.780
First, he adds a brief note that tells the underwriter it is part of a larger account

12:36.780 --> 12:38.380
that is clean account.

12:38.380 --> 12:48.380
See main office number one.

12:48.380 --> 12:51.900
He clicks confirm.

12:51.900 --> 12:55.300
The quote has been referred to the assigned underwriter for review.

12:55.300 --> 12:59.900
An activity has been created for the underwriter review and approval.

12:59.900 --> 13:05.780
Immediately, Archie sees the new activity, review and approve for commercial property

13:05.780 --> 13:09.820
for right construction assigned to Christine Kraft, the underwriter.

13:09.820 --> 13:19.460
The activity was created by Archie Armstrong with a note for Christine Kraft.

13:19.460 --> 13:25.220
The next stop on our tour of insurance suite for the cloud is policy center.

13:25.220 --> 13:30.100
Policy center provides full end to end policy management and issuance functionality including

13:30.100 --> 13:35.300
quoting, rating, underwriting, policy generation, and statistical reporting.

13:35.300 --> 13:40.260
It offers seamless integration between core functionality and predictive analytics.

13:40.260 --> 13:46.460
Policy center enables agents and underwriters to create and manage policies, handle inquiries

13:46.460 --> 13:53.780
and service accounts, evaluate risks, view policies, create activities.

13:53.780 --> 13:59.860
Policy center brings efficiency to every step from submission to renewal.

13:59.860 --> 14:04.780
In the previous demonstration, we met Archie Armstrong, an agent who created two submissions

14:04.780 --> 14:06.660
using producer engage.

14:06.660 --> 14:11.060
The second submission raised an underwriting issue because of an older building.

14:11.060 --> 14:15.260
In this next demonstration, we meet Christine Kraft, the underwriter who was assigned at

14:15.260 --> 14:19.340
the issue.

14:19.340 --> 14:22.780
Christine Kraft begins by logging into policy center.

14:22.780 --> 14:26.900
Policy center is a role based application, which means everything from screen flow to

14:26.900 --> 14:32.220
access to data is based on permissions granted to Christine's role as an underwriter.

14:32.220 --> 14:34.860
The summary screen is Christine's desktop.

14:34.860 --> 14:38.220
As you can see, the desktop is designed for ease of use.

14:38.220 --> 14:42.300
All the data that is pertinent to Christine's role is either displayed on the screen or is

14:42.300 --> 14:44.500
available at the click of a button.

14:44.500 --> 14:48.140
Here is the review and approve activity for right construction that was just sent from

14:48.140 --> 14:50.180
producer engage.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.940
Before Christine opens the activity, let us take a few minutes to take a brief tour of

14:53.940 --> 14:55.300
policy center.

14:55.300 --> 14:58.940
I have already mentioned the intuitive design of the summary screen.

14:58.940 --> 15:03.380
Like producer engage, policy center is a framework that is intended to be lightly configured

15:03.380 --> 15:05.140
by each customer.

15:05.140 --> 15:08.700
The sidebar on the left contains the actions menu at the top.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.100
This menu is dynamic.

15:10.100 --> 15:14.820
The available menu options vary based on the current context and the role of the user.

15:14.820 --> 15:23.300
For example, from the summary screen, Christine can create a new submission or a new account.

15:23.300 --> 15:27.900
In addition, the sidebar provides menu links for quick access to the summary screen to

15:27.900 --> 15:32.100
activities, submissions, renewals, and so on.

15:32.100 --> 15:37.660
Across the top are tabs for accessing accounts, policies, contacts, and search.

15:37.660 --> 15:39.700
Christine can search by account number.

15:39.700 --> 15:44.220
She can select new account or, on the policy tab, start a new submission.

15:44.220 --> 15:47.140
Policy center has sophisticated search functionality.

15:47.140 --> 15:51.780
The built-in search uses solid platform capability, which provides features such as sounds like

15:51.780 --> 15:53.620
and fuzzy search.

15:53.620 --> 15:58.540
The options available on the administration tab are based on Christine's role and permissions.

15:58.540 --> 16:03.860
Users and security gives her access to users, organizations, producer codes, and so on.

16:03.860 --> 16:13.180
Now, let us look at the right construction account.

16:13.180 --> 16:16.300
Christine clicks the link to the account holder summary dashboard.

16:16.300 --> 16:20.060
An account holder is the primary contact associated with an account.

16:20.060 --> 16:24.780
This screen provides a complete 360-degree picture of the customer relationship and current

16:24.780 --> 16:28.980
interactions by displaying data across all accounts for which the contact is the account

16:28.980 --> 16:29.980
holder.

16:29.980 --> 16:34.980
The account holder summary is especially useful for customer service representatives.

16:34.980 --> 16:38.500
Notice the billing and claims health check on the right-hand side of the screen.

16:38.500 --> 16:44.580
Below are the policies owned by right construction, any open policy transactions, and open claims.

16:44.580 --> 16:48.780
Christine can access the details for a policy or claim by clicking the hyperlink reference

16:48.780 --> 16:49.780
number.

16:49.780 --> 16:54.540
Again, thanks to seamless integration of insurance suite, she can view policy, claim, and billing

16:54.540 --> 16:57.780
data all on the same screen.

16:57.780 --> 17:01.420
Christine scrolls back to the top and clicks the link to the account summary for right

17:01.420 --> 17:07.620
construction.

17:07.620 --> 17:13.380
The overview area provides the ability to recalculate the three-year premium, loss ratio, and total

17:13.380 --> 17:14.380
losses.

17:14.380 --> 17:21.580
Below that is the billing health check.

17:21.580 --> 17:25.740
Here is a list of current activities, then then a list of enforced policies.

17:25.740 --> 17:31.780
Christine clicks the first policy number to view the latest policy for right construction.

17:31.780 --> 17:36.340
The policy summary screen focuses on a single policy and provides the ability to calculate

17:36.340 --> 17:42.820
the term financials at the policy level.

17:42.820 --> 17:46.900
On the my summary screen, Christine examines the recent activity that was sent over by

17:46.900 --> 17:51.740
Archie Armstrong, our agent.

17:51.740 --> 17:56.100
The activity detail indicates this is a review and approve activity.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.300
Christine clicks view notes for details.

17:58.300 --> 18:02.020
She sees that this is part of a larger account, which is a clean account.

18:02.020 --> 18:04.340
See the main office first location.

18:04.340 --> 18:09.180
She puts the submission in edit mode, in case she needs to make any changes.

18:09.180 --> 18:13.060
Notice this editable submission has a similar format to the wizard driven workflow that you

18:13.060 --> 18:14.740
saw in producer engage.

18:14.740 --> 18:19.180
However, as an internal user with the role of underwriter, Christine has more access

18:19.180 --> 18:23.380
than agents have when using producer engage.

18:23.380 --> 18:25.620
Christine clicks buildings and locations.

18:25.620 --> 18:29.220
She knows to look specifically at main office building number one.

18:29.220 --> 18:33.380
She notes that the year built is 1984, as Archie entered it.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.700
Christine realizes the age of the building should not be a problem because the account

18:36.700 --> 18:39.820
is clean, and this is only one of several buildings.

18:39.820 --> 18:45.540
This screen provides the same import or export capability that Archie used in producer engage.

18:45.540 --> 18:50.300
From here, Christine can proceed to rate the risk.

18:50.300 --> 18:54.340
She is routed to the quote screen, where you can see the total cost broken out by total

18:54.340 --> 18:58.100
premium and taxes and surcharges.

18:58.100 --> 19:00.300
There are also two errors displayed in red.

19:00.300 --> 19:04.940
The first error states, this policy has one or more outstanding contingencies.

19:04.940 --> 19:10.060
The second error says, this quote will require underwriting approval prior to binding.

19:10.060 --> 19:13.740
These messages proactively let the underwriter know that there are some items that need to

19:13.740 --> 19:16.780
be taken care of before the policy can be issued.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.700
If Christine tries to finish quote, the pre quote issues screen lists the issues that

19:20.700 --> 19:22.460
are blocking the quote.

19:22.460 --> 19:25.860
Christine's next step is to go to the risk analysis tab and approve the issues that

19:25.860 --> 19:27.700
are blocking bind.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.860
She clicks the risk analysis tab.

19:29.860 --> 19:33.420
The underwriting issues tab is where Christine can view the issues that are blocking the

19:33.420 --> 19:37.940
quote and either approve them and continue on with the workflow or reject them.

19:37.940 --> 19:45.020
If she approves the issue, she can then bind and issue the policy.

19:45.020 --> 19:47.500
Let us look at the predictive analytics tab.

19:47.500 --> 19:52.460
The data on this screen illustrates the capability of guidewire predictive analytics.

19:52.460 --> 19:56.100
Embedded data and analytics ensure that you know what's working, what's not, and what

19:56.100 --> 19:57.100
to do next.

19:57.100 --> 20:01.580
Currently, you see data based on pre-built models that are embedded into the workflow.

20:01.580 --> 20:04.900
These represent one approach to predictive analytics.

20:04.900 --> 20:09.940
Guidewire also supports a BYOM or bring your own models approach by enabling deployment,

20:09.940 --> 20:15.020
integration, and monitoring of predictive models created using third party tools.

20:15.020 --> 20:18.900
This dashboard shows an example of the risk models that we provide.

20:18.900 --> 20:22.580
Profitability, customer retention, and expense reduction.

20:22.580 --> 20:26.980
These analytics can be used as suggestions or they can provide input for automation,

20:26.980 --> 20:30.420
which is the case for the inspection contingency workflow.

20:30.420 --> 20:34.380
Here you can see that a contingency has automatically been attached to the policy based on these

20:34.380 --> 20:43.060
predictive analytics.

20:43.060 --> 20:47.500
In the demonstration, the predictive analytics dashboard showed an example of how real-time

20:47.500 --> 20:51.540
predictive insights are embedded in guidewire core systems.

20:51.540 --> 20:55.220
Predictive analytics involves building models to predict future results.

20:55.220 --> 20:59.340
It provides guidance to frontline decision makers while continuously measuring business

20:59.340 --> 21:00.340
value.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.980
Predictive analytics for profitability helps by improving rating sophistication and granularity

21:04.980 --> 21:08.220
while identifying and addressing pricing inaccuracies.

21:08.220 --> 21:11.220
It improves underwriting profitability.

21:11.220 --> 21:14.700
Predictive analytics for claims helps better manage claim indemnity and loss adjustment

21:14.700 --> 21:18.420
expenses.

21:18.420 --> 21:23.540
In this section, Christine Kraft, an underwriter, took us on a brief tour of policy center,

21:23.540 --> 21:25.700
where she handled an underwriting issue.

21:25.700 --> 21:29.940
We also visited the predictive analytics dashboard and viewed a contingency that was automatically

21:29.940 --> 21:33.740
attached to the policy based on these predictive analytics.

21:33.740 --> 21:38.500
The next tour stop is, customer engage account management.

21:38.500 --> 21:42.900
Customer engage account management is a digital, self-service application that enables customers

21:42.900 --> 21:46.740
to view and manage every aspect of their insurance account.

21:46.740 --> 21:51.140
Customers have clear visibility into claim handling processes and operations.

21:51.140 --> 21:55.540
Customer engage enriches the overall claims experience for policy holders.

21:55.540 --> 22:00.100
Thanks to seamless integration with policy center, claim center, and billing center,

22:00.100 --> 22:04.980
customers can view their invoices, policies, and claims, manage bills, make payments, and

22:04.980 --> 22:07.140
manage payment schedules.

22:07.140 --> 22:13.140
As you will see in our demonstration, a customer can file a claim and update personal information.

22:13.140 --> 22:17.180
In the previous demonstrations, we have looked at the policy life cycle from the viewpoint

22:17.180 --> 22:19.700
of an agent and then an underwriter.

22:19.700 --> 22:23.780
In this next demonstration, we will switch to the customer perspective as we take a tour

22:24.020 --> 22:26.020
of customer engage account management.

22:26.020 --> 22:30.180
Meet Ben Wright, a customer who needs to file a claim.

22:30.180 --> 22:34.820
Ben Wright of Wright Construction begins by logging into customer engage account management.

22:34.820 --> 22:44.020
Wright Construction is the same account we have been working with in the previous demonstrations.

22:44.020 --> 22:46.820
Ben's home page is the account summary screen.

22:46.820 --> 22:50.420
This screen was designed to answer the main questions that customers have when they call

22:50.420 --> 22:52.820
a customer service representative.

22:52.820 --> 22:54.260
What is my balance?

22:54.260 --> 22:55.860
Is anything past due?

22:55.860 --> 22:57.780
If so, can I pay it?

22:57.780 --> 22:59.620
And when is my next bill?

22:59.620 --> 23:03.940
Answers to these questions are clearly displayed across the top of Ben's home screen.

23:03.940 --> 23:06.820
Ben can also see all policies held by his account.

23:06.820 --> 23:11.700
The account summary screen is another example of the seamless integration of policy, claims,

23:11.700 --> 23:12.900
and billing functionality.

23:14.980 --> 23:19.140
From this application, Ben can file a first notice of loss for a claim.

23:19.140 --> 23:20.340
He can purchase insurance.

23:20.740 --> 23:22.820
He can make payments.

23:25.140 --> 23:28.900
On the billing summary, Ben can view the billing and payment details for each of the

23:28.900 --> 23:30.740
Wright Construction policies.

23:30.740 --> 23:33.380
He can also make a payment or set up automatic payments.

23:34.180 --> 23:38.260
Similarly, the claims tab provides a list of hyperlinked claim numbers for claims

23:38.260 --> 23:42.580
filed by Wright Construction with the status of each claim and the number of the related policy.

23:43.380 --> 23:47.060
Ben returns to his home screen and locates the most recent policy.

23:47.060 --> 23:50.020
He clicks, file a claim to start a first notice of loss.

23:51.300 --> 23:57.220
Guidewire empowers insurers, placing billing, policy, and claims functionality at their fingertips.

23:58.740 --> 23:59.940
Here is the new claim tab.

24:00.580 --> 24:05.300
Notice the loss date is pre-filled with today's date, and the policy number is pre-selected.

24:05.300 --> 24:09.700
After Ben clicks next, the claim information work tree is displayed on the left side,

24:09.700 --> 24:12.340
showing the steps of this wizard-driven workflow.

24:12.340 --> 24:16.500
The next step is for Ben to describe what happened, why he is filing a claim.

24:16.500 --> 24:19.540
He selects the loss cause and enters the date of notice.

24:19.620 --> 24:22.340
The important point here is not the details of this claim,

24:22.340 --> 24:25.540
but the ease with which an insured is able to capture the claim details.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.300
Ben goes on to select the affected building.

24:32.100 --> 24:36.580
As anyone who has taken a first notice of loss will attest, this is a stressful situation.

24:37.140 --> 24:41.780
Customer engage is designed to make this process as easy and painless as possible.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.380
Ben has entered the claim details.

24:45.140 --> 24:49.300
He selects the address from a list of addresses associated with his account.

24:49.300 --> 24:54.260
In the next step, Ben will have the opportunity to upload any pictures or supporting documents.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.780
If there are witnesses or other third parties, he can add them here.

24:57.780 --> 25:00.500
Ben simply adds himself as a contact and clicks next.

25:10.100 --> 25:13.700
The new claim summary provides Ben the opportunity to make sure the information

25:13.700 --> 25:15.220
is correct and complete.

25:15.220 --> 25:16.820
And he is ready to submit the claim.

25:20.260 --> 25:22.820
The claim has been successfully submitted.

25:22.820 --> 25:25.220
A unique claim number has been attached to the claim.

25:26.020 --> 25:29.300
Behind the scenes, the workflow has automatically triaged the claim

25:29.300 --> 25:32.660
and assigned it to a claims adjuster based on the characteristics of the claim.

25:33.220 --> 25:37.220
Productivity is improved by ensuring the right claim to assign to the right adjuster.

25:39.700 --> 25:43.060
In this demonstration, Ben Wright, a policyholder,

25:43.060 --> 25:46.100
filed a claim using customer engage account management.

25:46.180 --> 25:49.300
In the next section, the adjuster who was assigned to the new claim

25:49.300 --> 25:50.980
will examine the claim and claim center.

25:56.020 --> 25:59.460
Next stop on the tour, claim center and the guidewire cloud platform.

26:01.860 --> 26:06.820
Guidewire claim center is the PNC industry's most trusted claims management solution.

26:06.820 --> 26:10.580
Claim center manages the entire claims process from first notice of loss

26:10.580 --> 26:12.740
through a execution of financial transactions.

26:13.540 --> 26:17.940
With claim center, your claims teams have real time access to the information they need

26:17.940 --> 26:19.060
when they need it.

26:19.060 --> 26:22.980
When Scott logs into claim center, he also has instant access to relevant

26:22.980 --> 26:27.140
information stored in policy center, billing center, and contact manager

26:27.140 --> 26:30.020
thanks to the seamless integration of all insurance suite products.

26:30.820 --> 26:35.380
Claim center enables claims automation to free up your resources to focus on complex

26:35.380 --> 26:40.580
claims and easily defines when and how exposures, reserves and activities are created.

26:40.580 --> 26:44.820
Claim center ensures compliance with corporate policies and claims best practices

26:44.820 --> 26:46.020
throughout your organization.

26:49.060 --> 26:51.780
In the previous demonstration, we met Ben Wright,

26:51.780 --> 26:55.940
a policyholder who filed a claim using customer engage account management.

26:55.940 --> 26:59.860
Based on the claim characteristics, automated workflow has assigned Ben's first

26:59.860 --> 27:02.340
notice of loss to Scott Henson, a claims adjuster.

27:03.060 --> 27:06.740
In this next demonstration, the persona of Scott, a claim adjuster,

27:06.740 --> 27:08.500
will view the new claim and claim center.

27:11.140 --> 27:14.260
Scott logs into claim center.

27:14.260 --> 27:17.540
Like policy center, claim center is a role based application.

27:18.100 --> 27:22.180
Everything that follows from screen flow to data access is based on Scott's role as a

27:22.180 --> 27:23.060
claims adjuster.

27:23.780 --> 27:28.020
Scott immediately sees two activities on his summary screen that are related to the first

27:28.020 --> 27:32.180
notice of loss that Ben filed just minutes ago from customer engage account management.

27:32.900 --> 27:37.460
Before Scott addresses the new claim, let us take a few minutes for a brief tour of claim center.

27:37.780 --> 27:42.740
As in policy center, the actions menu and claims center is dynamic, varying the menu options that

27:42.740 --> 27:46.340
are available to Scott based on his permissions and on the current context.

27:46.340 --> 27:50.740
The sidebar provides additional menu links for quick access to activities,

27:50.740 --> 27:54.980
claims, exposures, subrogations, pending adjustments, and so on.

27:55.620 --> 28:00.580
Across the top in the tab bar, Scott can start a first notice of loss or search for a claim.

28:03.380 --> 28:05.380
The team tab, which is available to Scott,

28:05.860 --> 28:10.580
the team tab, which is available to managers and supervisors, provides a visual management

28:10.580 --> 28:14.580
tool for managing groups that Scott supervises and any subgroups of those groups.

28:15.300 --> 28:18.660
At this point, Scott clicks the claim number to examine the new claim.

28:19.300 --> 28:23.460
Of course, since this is a new claim, there is not much detail yet.

28:23.460 --> 28:27.300
The summary screen provides an overview of how the claim is performing.

28:27.300 --> 28:30.100
In the basics area, you see the associated target,

28:30.100 --> 28:33.140
which is calculated by a rule and is specific to the insurer.

28:33.940 --> 28:37.140
If there were a potential large loss associated with the loss,

28:37.140 --> 28:39.700
a high risk indicator would be displayed in the top right.

28:40.660 --> 28:42.980
Currently, no exposures are listed for the claim.

28:43.780 --> 28:47.620
Guidewire provides an automated exposure and reserve creation capability.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.580
Services attached to the claim would be listed here.

28:54.340 --> 28:58.980
Scott views the planned activities, which are based on business logic and are part of the claims tree.

28:58.980 --> 29:05.060
Notice the health metrics tab, which shows several health metrics that have been run

29:05.060 --> 29:08.340
against the claim and indicate how efficiently the claim is being processed.

29:09.860 --> 29:13.140
The policy tab gives Scott a view into the policy related to the claim.

29:13.700 --> 29:18.420
He can see the locations, coverages, and limits without having to switch back and forth between

29:18.420 --> 29:19.940
claim center and policy center.

29:22.820 --> 29:25.380
Claim financials are available on the financials tab.

29:26.020 --> 29:28.980
Of course, for a new claim, there is not much to show yet.

29:31.780 --> 29:35.860
Starting with the first demonstration and ending with this demonstration in claim center,

29:35.860 --> 29:38.340
you have now walked through a day in the life of a policy.

29:40.900 --> 29:44.180
The final stop on our tour of Guidewire Cloud is Explore.

29:44.180 --> 29:48.980
You will see what Guidewire provides from a business intelligence and operational reporting standpoint.

29:49.540 --> 29:54.020
Explore is a cloud-native data analytics and visualization application that enables you to

29:54.020 --> 29:57.300
explore data from your Guidewire insurance suite applications.

29:57.300 --> 30:01.460
Each Explore dashboard includes several visualizations that represent your data.

30:02.260 --> 30:08.180
With Explore, you can analyze your data to discover new insights, visualize and collaborate

30:08.180 --> 30:12.180
to improve business effectiveness, accelerate decision-making,

30:12.260 --> 30:17.300
Explore streams data from core systems and other sources into a scalable data infrastructure to

30:17.300 --> 30:20.900
provide near real-time insights and enable smart business decisions.

30:22.660 --> 30:27.700
For our final demonstration, Sonya Weber, an insurance manager, will take you on a tour of

30:27.700 --> 30:29.540
Guidewire Live Analytics and Explore.

30:33.860 --> 30:38.340
Explore is a cloud-only service that provides 10 pre-built operational dashboards,

30:38.980 --> 30:45.300
which provide valuable near-real-time insights into claim and policy performance.

30:46.020 --> 30:50.980
As an insurance manager, Sonya needs up-to-the-minute feedback on how claims are performing.

30:50.980 --> 30:55.940
The first tab Sonya sees is Claim Center Open Inventory Management, which provides an operational

30:55.940 --> 31:00.980
overview of how the claim process is performing. The dashboard is fed in near-real-time from our

31:00.980 --> 31:04.980
data lake based on claims, and can be used to optimize your claims operations.

31:05.620 --> 31:10.020
Sonya sees there are currently 207 open claims, with a total incurred of more than

31:10.020 --> 31:14.660
three and a half million dollars. She looks over to the right to view various claim metrics,

31:14.660 --> 31:19.620
such as open claims by segment and open claims by assigned group. In the lower left,

31:19.620 --> 31:25.140
is claim volume by user which is ordered by overdue activities. These, and other metrics,

31:25.140 --> 31:30.580
help Sonya optimize her everyday claims management. An important feature of Explore is the ability to

31:30.580 --> 31:36.340
export the data from any of the dashboards in raw or CSV format. Sonya can easily send the charts

31:36.340 --> 31:41.220
and figures displayed on her dashboard to a downstream reporting system. Another dashboard

31:41.220 --> 31:45.300
that aids Sonya in assessing claim performance is the Claim Center Activity Workflow.

31:47.380 --> 31:51.460
Here she can see at a glance activity metrics, such as the number of activities,

31:51.460 --> 31:55.060
with metrics on average hours create to close in subject of the activity.

31:55.860 --> 32:01.940
Here is a breakdown of activities by assigned user. Explore also features several policy reports,

32:01.940 --> 32:05.860
grouped under two categories, underwriting conversion and underwriting efficiency.

32:10.100 --> 32:14.260
The active submissions dashboard presents an analysis of open submissions.

32:14.260 --> 32:19.220
The horizontal toolbar along the top consists of dynamic filters that enable users to update

32:19.220 --> 32:24.740
the display by effective date, company, line of business, and product. A filter can also be added

32:24.740 --> 32:33.780
to bring in criteria from the product model. Let us take a brief look at underwriting efficiency.

32:38.660 --> 32:43.620
Here you can see there are 218 underwriting issues with an average of two days to close.

32:43.620 --> 32:48.660
The chart on the right shows underwriting issues by type. Maybe Sonya has a particular

32:48.660 --> 32:52.340
underwriting issue that is being flagged significantly more often than the rest,

32:52.340 --> 32:55.700
causing a processing bottleneck for the straight through processing workflow.

32:56.260 --> 32:59.780
Sonya can see in near real time, the issue that is causing the bottleneck.

33:00.340 --> 33:03.540
Scrolling down, we see the underwriting issues search report.

33:07.860 --> 33:13.060
And above the search list is a reminder that Sonya can export the data in raw or CSV format.

33:15.300 --> 33:17.860
She can also create ad hoc operational reports.

33:22.820 --> 33:26.660
