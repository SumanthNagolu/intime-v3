## 🎯 Philosophy

**Simple > Complex**

Instead of orchestrating 8 separate agents through workflows:
- ✅ Direct conversation
- ✅ Natural task breakdown
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Flexible iteration

I (Claude) naturally handle all roles:
- Strategic thinking (CEO/CFO perspective)
- Planning (PM/Architect)
- Implementation (Developer/Database)
- Quality (QA/Code Review/Security)
- Operations (Deployment/DevOps)

See `AGENTS-REFERENCE.md` for details.

## 🚀 How to Use

**Just talk directly:**
```
"Build the student enrollment feature"
"Review this code for security issues"
"Deploy Epic 2 to production"
"Help me plan the next sprint"
```

I'll handle:
1. Requirements gathering
2. Architecture design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployment planning

See `QUICK-COMMANDS.md` for common patterns.
