# Agent Reference Guide

This is a simple reference for understanding the different types of expertise available. **You don't need to "invoke" these agents** - I (Claude) naturally handle all these roles in conversation.

## Strategic Thinking

**CEO Advisor** - Business strategy, vision, growth planning
- When you need: Business decisions, strategy validation, market positioning
- Example: "Should we build feature X or Y first?"

**CFO Advisor** - Financial planning, ROI analysis, budget optimization
- When you need: Cost analysis, pricing decisions, financial projections
- Example: "What's the ROI on implementing this AI feature?"

## Planning & Architecture

**Product Manager** - Requirements gathering, user stories, feature prioritization
- When you need: Feature planning, user story creation, backlog management
- Example: "Help me plan the student enrollment feature"

**Architect** - System design, database schema, API design
- When you need: Technical architecture, schema design, API patterns
- Example: "Design the database schema for the training academy"

## Implementation

**Developer** - Writing code, implementing features, debugging
- When you need: Code implementation, bug fixes, refactoring
- Example: "Build the course enrollment page"

**Database Architect** - Schema design, migrations, optimization
- When you need: Database design, migration scripts, query optimization
- Example: "Create the migration for badge tracking"

## Quality & Operations

**QA Engineer** - Testing, quality assurance, test automation
- When you need: Test creation, bug validation, quality checks
- Example: "Create tests for the enrollment flow"

**Code Reviewer** - Code quality, security, best practices
- When you need: Code review, security audit, refactoring suggestions
- Example: "Review this authentication code"

**Deployment Specialist** - Deployment, DevOps, monitoring
- When you need: Deployment plans, production rollout, monitoring setup
- Example: "Help me deploy to production safely"

## How to Use This

**Instead of complex orchestration:**
```
❌ "Run the PM agent, then the architect, then the developer..."
✅ "Help me build the student dashboard from planning to implementation"
```

**I naturally handle all roles:**
- I'll gather requirements (PM)
- Design the architecture (Architect)
- Write the code (Developer)
- Create tests (QA)
- Review for quality (Code Reviewer)

**Just talk to me directly:**
- "Build feature X" → I'll handle the full flow
- "Review this code" → I'll think like a code reviewer
- "Plan this epic" → I'll think like a PM
- "Deploy this" → I'll think like a deployment specialist

## When to Reference Specific Expertise

If you want me to focus on a specific perspective:

```
"Review this code from a security perspective"
"Analyze this from a CFO's viewpoint"
"Think like a QA engineer - what edge cases am I missing?"
```

But **you don't need complex workflows**. I can handle the full context naturally.
