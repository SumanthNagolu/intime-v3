# Quick Command Reference

Simple patterns for common tasks. **Just ask directly** - no slash commands or orchestration needed.

## Feature Development

```
✅ "Build the student enrollment feature"
✅ "Implement the course progress tracking"
✅ "Add badge system with leaderboards"
```

I'll naturally handle:
1. Understanding requirements
2. Designing the solution
3. Writing the code
4. Creating tests
5. Helping you deploy

## Database Work

```
✅ "Design the schema for the training academy"
✅ "Create a migration for badge tracking"
✅ "Add RLS policies for student data"
```

I'll handle schema design, migrations, and security.

## Code Review & Quality

```
✅ "Review this authentication code"
✅ "Check this for security vulnerabilities"
✅ "Refactor this component for better performance"
```

I'll think from a code reviewer and security auditor perspective.

## Testing

```
✅ "Create tests for the enrollment flow"
✅ "Write E2E tests for student dashboard"
✅ "Test this component for edge cases"
```

I'll write comprehensive test coverage.

## Deployment

```
✅ "Help me deploy Epic 2 to production"
✅ "Create a safe deployment plan with rollback"
✅ "Check if this is production-ready"
```

I'll create deployment plans with safety checks.

## Planning & Strategy

```
✅ "Help me plan the next sprint"
✅ "Break down Epic 3 into stories"
✅ "Should we build feature X or Y first?"
```

I'll think like a PM and strategist.

## Business Analysis

```
✅ "What's the ROI on implementing this AI feature?"
✅ "Analyze the cost of the current architecture"
✅ "Review this from a business perspective"
```

I'll think like a CEO/CFO advisor.

## Multi-Step Workflows

For complex tasks, I'll use TodoWrite to track progress:

```
You: "Deploy Epic 2 to production"

Me:
1. ✅ Review Epic 2 implementation
2. 🔄 Create deployment plan
3. ⏳ Run pre-deployment checks
4. ⏳ Execute deployment
5. ⏳ Verify production
```

You'll see progress in real-time.

## Tips for Best Results

**Be Specific:**
```
❌ "Fix the bug"
✅ "Fix the authentication error on signup page"
```

**Give Context:**
```
❌ "Build a feature"
✅ "Build student enrollment. Requirements: prerequisites check, payment integration, email confirmation"
```

**Iterate in Conversation:**
```
You: "Build course enrollment"
Me: [asks about prerequisites, payment flow]
You: "Students need to complete prerequisite courses first"
Me: [implements with that logic]
```

**Remember:** No complex workflows, no orchestration, no slash commands needed. Just talk to me like you would a senior developer who knows your entire codebase.
