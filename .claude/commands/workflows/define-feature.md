description: Stage 1 - Define a new feature and its business value
---

I'll help you define a new feature using the PM Agent.

**What This Does:**
1. Interviews you about the business capability
2. Documents success metrics and ROI
3. Identifies proposed epics
4. Creates feature canvas document

**Process:**
- PM Agent will ask questions about business value, users, metrics
- Output: `docs/planning/features/[feature-name].md`
- Next step: Run `/workflows:create-epics [feature-name]`

Let me spawn the PM Agent to guide you through feature definition...
