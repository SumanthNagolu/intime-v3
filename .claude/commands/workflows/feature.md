description: Complete end-to-end feature development workflow (PM → Architect → Developer → QA → Deploy)
---

I'll route this through our complete feature development pipeline:

**Pipeline Stages**:
1. **PM Agent** - Gather requirements and create user stories
2. **Architect Agent** - Design database schema, API contracts, and component architecture
3. **Developer Agent** - Implement the feature with clean, tested code
4. **QA Agent** - Run comprehensive tests and quality verification
5. **Deployment Agent** - Deploy to production safely

This is the full production workflow. Each agent will:
- Read the previous agent's output
- Complete their specialized work
- Output documentation for the next agent

**Estimated time**: 1-2 hours depending on feature complexity

Let me start by spawning the PM Agent to gather requirements...
