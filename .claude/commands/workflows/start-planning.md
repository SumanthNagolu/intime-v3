description: Start requirements gathering and planning for a new feature or epic
---

I'll help you start planning a new feature. I'll route this through our PM Agent to gather comprehensive requirements.

The PM Agent will:
1. Ask clarifying questions about the feature
2. Understand business context and cross-pillar impact
3. Create user stories with acceptance criteria
4. Define success metrics
5. Output `requirements.md` for the next phase

Let me spawn the PM Agent to begin requirements gathering...
