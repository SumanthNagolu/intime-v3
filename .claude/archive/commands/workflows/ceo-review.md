I'll consult our business strategy advisors to provide comprehensive analysis.

**Analysis Coverage**:

**CEO Advisor** will analyze:
- Market opportunity and competitive positioning
- Strategic fit with 5-pillar business model
- Cross-pollination potential across business units
- Alignment with 5-year vision
- GO/NO-GO/PIVOT recommendation

**CFO Advisor** will analyze:
- Financial impact and ROI calculation
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Pricing strategy recommendations
- Budget allocation
- Financial risk assessment

Both advisors will consider:
- InTime's 5-pillar business model
- Cross-pollination opportunities (1 conversation = 5+ leads)
- 2-person pod economics
- Year 1 revenue targets ($1M-2M)

Let me spawn both advisors in parallel for comprehensive business guidance...
