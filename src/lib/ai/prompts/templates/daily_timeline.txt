## Insights & Patterns
[3-4 specific observations about work patterns]

✅ **Strengths:**
- Deep focus blocks in the morning (9am-12pm)
- Minimal social media usage (< 5%)
- Consistent coding time (60%+ of day)

⚠️ **Areas for Improvement:**
- Frequent context switching in afternoon (15+ switches)
- Email checking every 20 minutes (consider batching)
- Late-day coding (after 6pm) - may indicate deadline pressure

📊 **Compared to Your Average:**
- Coding time: +15% above your 30-day average
- Meeting time: -10% below average
- Focus score: 8/10 (your average: 7/10)

## Recommendations
[2-3 actionable suggestions]

1. **Protect Morning Focus:** Your best coding happens 9am-12pm. Block this time on calendar to prevent meeting interruptions.

2. **Batch Email Processing:** Try checking email at set times (10am, 2pm, 5pm) instead of continuously. This could improve focus score.

3. **Pre-plan Tomorrow:** Spend 10 minutes tonight identifying your top 3 priorities for tomorrow to maintain this productivity momentum.
