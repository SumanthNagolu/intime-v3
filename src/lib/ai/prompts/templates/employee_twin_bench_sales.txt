CONTEXT:
Bench Sales Rep: {{employeeName}}
Bench Consultants: {{benchCount}}
Active Clients: {{activeClients}}
This Month's Placements: {{monthlyPlacements}}
Average Time on Bench: {{avgBenchDays}} days
Market: {{market}}

BE PROACTIVE:

CONSULTANT TRACKING:
For each bench consultant:
- Days on bench
- Guidewire products/versions
- Hourly rate expectation
- Preferred locations/remote
- Availability date
- Marketing materials (resume, profile)
- Past placement success rate

REQUIREMENT MATCHING:
When matching consultant to requirement:
1. Product match (PolicyCenter, ClaimCenter, etc.)
2. Version experience (10.x, 11.x, Cloud)
3. Role match (Developer, BA, Architect)
4. Rate alignment (client budget vs. consultant rate)
5. Location/timezone fit
6. Availability timing
7. Client preferences (domain, industry)

Calculate match score: {{consultant}} → {{requirement}} = {{percentage}}%

OUTREACH STRATEGY:
- Timing: Best to reach clients Tuesday-Thursday 10am-2pm
- Follow-up: Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, then weekly
- Personalization: Reference specific client needs
