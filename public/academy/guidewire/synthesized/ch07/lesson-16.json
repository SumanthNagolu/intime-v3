      "narrative": "Imagine a scenario where your users need to manage complex data, but the current interface is limiting. As shown in **Figure 1 (Slide 3)**, a business analyst from an insurance company has a common problem: their `Policy list view` panel currently only exposes a limited number of policy entity fields. Users can add, remove, and edit some details, but with the anticipated need to add 5-10 more fields in the near future, the existing editable list view panel is becoming insufficient. This highlights a frequent challenge in application design: how to provide detailed views and editing capabilities for objects without cluttering the main screen or forcing users through multiple navigation steps.\n\nWhile **Figure 2 (Slide 4)** might represent the current limited view or the potential for a new, more flexible solution, the core of our application's navigation relies on fundamental PCF elements called **Locations**. As a quick review, **Figure 3 (Slide 5)** reminds us that a location is a specific point in the application's user interface to which a user can navigate. Importantly, locations themselves do not define any visual content directly; instead, they act as containers for `Screen container(s)` which *do* define the visual elements. Furthermore, locations are crucial for controlling user access, as they can leverage system permissions to determine what users can see or access within the application. The challenge from our user story is that simply adding more fields to the existing list view panel isn't scalable or user-friendly. This limitation, coupled with the need for a focused interaction, points us towards a more dynamic and dedicated UI element: the popup.",

      "heading": "Introducing Guidewire Popups and Their Advantages",
      "narrative": "To address the limitations of list views and the need for focused interaction, Guidewire applications utilize **Popups**. As illustrated in **Figure 4 (Slide 6)**, a popup in Guidewire contains a single screen and is designed to return the user to the previous PCF location once it's closed. This provides a seamless user experience, often including an automatic 'Return to <previous location>' link, making navigation intuitive and efficient. Visually, **Figure 5 (Slide 7)** could represent the moment a popup appears, overlaying the main application content, providing a focused interaction without navigating away from the current context.\n\nYou might wonder why Guidewire implements its own popup mechanism rather than relying on standard browser popup windows. **Figure 6 (Slide 8)** clarifies the critical reasons. Firstly, many users configure their web browsers to block popups, even from trusted sources, leading to a poor user experience. More importantly, passing context and objects between separate browser windows can cause significant synchronization problems. Imagine multiple popups open for the same view, or a popup window remaining open after its parent window is closed – these scenarios can lead to data inconsistencies and usability issues. Guidewire popups are architected to provide virtually all the functionality of true popup windows while completely avoiding these blocking issues and synchronization problems, ensuring a robust and consistent user experience.",

      "heading": "Primary Use Cases for Guidewire Popups",
      "narrative": "Guidewire popups are incredibly versatile and serve three primary use cases, each designed to enhance user interaction and data management.\n\nThe first common use case is to **view and edit existing objects**. As depicted in **Figure 7 (Slide 9)**, a popup can be used to display and modify an object when it's not convenient to edit it directly within a location, or when some fields a user needs to view or edit aren't displayed in the main view. A classic example is a list view panel that only shows a limited number of object fields. Navigation cell widgets within such a list can be configured to open a popup, allowing users to access and edit all relevant object fields. When a popup edits an existing object, it doesn't return the object to the parent list view; instead, it commits the changes directly to the database. The parent list view then refreshes its data from the database to reflect these updates.\n\nSecondly, popups can be configured to **create new objects**. **Figure 8 (Slide 10)** illustrates this scenario. In many cases, a single popup can handle both the creation of new objects and the viewing/editing of existing ones. When a popup creates a new object, the source container (often a list view panel) doesn't initially know about this object. Therefore, the popup must return the newly created object to the source container, and the source must then commit the object to the appropriate array associated with the parent object.\n\nFinally, popups are excellent for **executing 'popped' searches**. **Figure 9 (Slide 11)** demonstrates how a popup can be configured to search for an existing record. This is particularly useful when search functionality is needed in a part of the user interface where it wouldn't be convenient to include a full search mechanism. The popup provides a dedicated, focused interface for searching, returning the selected record to the main screen.\n\n**Figure 10 (Slide 14)**, a generic screen, can be seen as a template or a blank canvas for any of these popup use cases, ready to be populated with specific fields for viewing, editing, creating, or searching, depending on its configuration and purpose.",
