      "narrative": "In many business applications, users require the flexibility to directly manipulate data displayed in lists. Consider a scenario where users need to manually add or remove policy summaries, creating new empty rows for data entry and only seeing checkboxes for selection when the list is in an active edit mode. This is precisely where **Editable List Views** become invaluable, transforming static displays into dynamic data management tools.\n\nTo achieve this, we leverage the **Iterator Buttons widget**. This powerful widget, when dragged onto a toolbar, automatically provides two essential buttons: **Add** and **Remove**. These buttons are pre-configured with smart visibility and availability logic: they only appear when the screen is in edit mode, and they are only enabled if their corresponding actions are properly defined. Specifically, the 'Remove' button also requires at least one row to be selected in the List View before it becomes active. This intelligent design ensures a streamlined and context-aware user experience, allowing users to efficiently manage list data without unnecessary clutter or confusion.",

      "heading": "Strategic Toolbar Placement and Row Iterator Configuration",
      "narrative": "The placement of your Iterator Buttons is crucial for an intuitive user interface. While toolbars can exist at various levels within the PCF architecture, a best practice is to place **Edit Buttons** (which control the overall screen transaction) at the screen level. For **Iterator Buttons**, the ideal location is the toolbar closest to the List View they control, often the same toolbar that displays the paginator. In simpler screens, a single toolbar might house both sets of buttons. This hierarchical approach ensures that actions are logically grouped and easily discoverable by the user.\n\nThe functionality of these 'Add' and 'Remove' buttons is directly governed by the **Row Iterator's properties**. Specifically, the `toCreateAndAdd` property defines the action taken when the 'Add' button is clicked, and `toRemove` specifies the action for the 'Remove' button. When configuring the 'Add' button, there are two common approaches: either a new empty row is inserted directly into the List View for in-line editing (ideal when all necessary fields are visible), or a pop-up window opens to allow the user to initialize the object's fields before it's added as a row. The choice depends on the complexity and number of fields requiring initialization. For instance, if a List View only shows a few key fields but the underlying object has many, a pop-up provides a better user experience for initial creation.",

      "heading": "Understanding the Editable Hierarchy for List View Cells",
      "narrative": "For a cell within a List View to be editable, it's not enough to simply set the cell's `editable` property to `true`. There's a crucial **editable hierarchy** that must be understood and correctly configured. The `editable` property cascades down from parent elements to their children, but with specific default behaviors at each level.\n\nBy default, a **List View panel's** `editable` property is blank, meaning it is editable. Similarly, a **row's** `editable` property is also blank and thus editable. However, the **Row Iterator's** `editable` property, while often blank, is *required* to be explicitly set to `true` (or a condition that evaluates to `true`) for any cells within its rows to become editable. Most importantly, a **cell's** `editable` property defaults to `false`. Therefore, to make a specific cell editable, you *must* explicitly set both the **Row Iterator's** `editable` property to `true` and the **cell's** `editable` property to `true` (or a condition). The List View Panel and individual rows can inherit their editable state, but the Row Iterator and the specific cells are the key elements you must configure directly. This granular control allows developers to precisely define which parts of a List View are interactive and modifiable by the user.",
