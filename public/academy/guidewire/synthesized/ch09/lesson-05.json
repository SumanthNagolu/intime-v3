      "narrative": "ClaimCenter is designed to streamline operations by automatically assigning various entities to users. In its base configuration, ClaimCenter can assign six primary types of entities: Claims, Exposures, Matters, Subrogations, Service Requests, and Activities. While these are the defaults, it's also possible to configure ClaimCenter to assign other custom entity types if your business needs require it. It's important to remember that the assignment process is hierarchical: an entity is first assigned to a group, and then to a specific user within that group.\n\nFor activities, ClaimCenter introduces the concept of **queues**. A queue acts as a holding area where activities 'wait' to be assigned to a user. Each group within your organization can have one or more associated queues. A powerful feature of queues is their ability to be shared; a queue defined on a parent group can be made visible to all its child groups. This allows users across both parent and child groups to access and manage activities within that queue. Group members with the necessary permissions can either assign activities from the queue to themselves or distribute them to other users, providing flexibility in workload management.",

      "heading": "Assignment Rule Sets and Flow Logic",
      "narrative": "Entity assignment in ClaimCenter typically involves a two-pass system using distinct rule sets. When an entity is created, if it's not manually assigned, the system first executes the **Global <Entity> Assignment Rules**. These rules are designed to assign the entity to the most appropriate group and, if possible, a specific user within that group. The Global rules have three potential outcomes:\n\n1.  **Group and User Assigned**: If a rule successfully assigns both a group and a user, the assignment process is complete.\n2.  **Group Assigned, No User**: If a rule assigns a group but not a specific user, the system then proceeds to run the **Default Group <Entity> Assignment Rules** for that assigned group. These rules attempt to assign a user within the group.\n3.  **No Group Assigned**: If none of the Global rules succeed in assigning a group, the entity is assigned to a special 'dummy' user called the **Default Owner** and the root group of the hierarchy, requiring manual intervention.\n\nThe Default Group rules focus on assigning the entity to a specific user within the already determined group. If successful, assignment is complete. If unsuccessful, these rules might assign the entity to a *new* group, causing the Default Group rules to run again for that new group. If no new group or user is assigned, the entity ultimately falls to the supervisor of the initially assigned group for manual assignment.\n\nAssignment to the 'Default Owner' is a critical indicator of flaws in your assignment rule logic. The Default Owner is not a real user you can log in as, and entities assigned here require extra overhead to identify and reassign. Best practice dictates implementing a default assignment rule at the bottom of every Global rule set to catch any uncaught entities and assign them to a designated group responsible for handling such situations, rather than letting them fall to the Default Owner.",

      "narrative": "For any entity to be assignable within ClaimCenter, it must implement the **CCAssignable delegate**. This delegate is fundamental, as it grants access to the `CurrentAssignment` property, which is central to the assignment process. All assignable objects in the base ClaimCenter application, such as Claims and Activities, already implement `CCAssignable`.\n\nIf you need to make a custom or additional entity type assignable, you must follow a structured approach:\n1.  **Implement the `CCAssignable` delegate** for that specific entity.\n2.  **Create assignment rule sets** for the new entity, including both Global and Default Group rule sets.\n3.  **Implement specific rules** within these new rule sets to define your assignment logic.\n4.  **Thoroughly test** your new assignment configuration to ensure it behaves as expected.\n\nThe `CurrentAssignment` property, accessible through the `CCAssignable` delegate, provides most of the methods used for assigning entities to groups and users. It also tracks crucial assignment-related information, including the assignment status, the current assignee (whether a queue or a specific user and group), the previous assignee, the user who last performed the assignment, and the timestamp of the last assignment. It's important to note that the `CurrentAssignment` method is only valid within the scope of the Assignment Rules; assignment operations performed elsewhere in the application cannot directly utilize `CurrentAssignment`.",

This capability is available on screens such as the FNOL Wizard, claim search results, the Team screen, Desktop screens, and through the Actions menu. When performing a manual assignment, users are presented with several options:\n\n*   **Use automated assignment**: This option triggers the underlying assignment rules, allowing the system to determine the best assignee based on your configured logic.\n*   **Select from list**: This provides a list of 'Suggested Assignees'. This list typically includes the current user, the current claim/exposure owner, and all members of the user's group to whom the entity can be assigned. For example, if you are a manager, all members of your team would appear here.\n*   **Find a user or group**: This option allows users to search for a specific group or user to assign the entity directly, bypassing the automated rules and suggested lists. This is particularly useful for targeted assignments or when a specific individual is known to be the most appropriate owner.\n\nManual assignment provides supervisors and users with the control to override automated decisions or handle exceptions, ensuring that work can always be directed to the right person when needed.",

      "narrative": "The `CurrentAssignment` property, derived from the `CCAssignable` delegate, exposes a rich set of methods designed for assigning entities to groups and users. Each of these assignment methods is unique in its characteristics and returns a Boolean value: `true` if the assignment was successful, and `false` if the appropriate group or user could not be assigned by that specific rule. This Boolean return value is incredibly useful for controlling the flow of your assignment rules.\n\nOnce an object has been successfully assigned to its final group and user, there's no need for the rule set to continue executing. In fact, allowing further rules to run introduces a risk of unintended reassignments. This is where the `actions.exit()` method becomes crucial. It immediately terminates the execution of the current rule set. The best practice is to wrap your assignment method calls within an `if` clause that checks the Boolean return value. This ensures that `actions.exit()` is called *only if* the assignment method was successful, preventing any subsequent rules from inadvertently altering the assignment. Adopting this approach for every assignment method in your rule sets ensures efficient and predictable assignment behavior.",

These include `assignGroup(group)` to assign to a named group, `assignGroupByRoundRobin(groupType, directChildrenOnlyGroup*)` to assign based on location and group type, `assign(group, user)` for specific user and group assignment, `assignByRoundRobin(group)` to assign to the next user in a cyclical fashion within a group, `assignByLocation(location, groupType, userAttributes, roundRobin)` to assign a user matching location criteria, `assignToIssueOwner()` for assigning to the claim or related exposure owner, and `assignManually(responsibleUser)` to assign to a specific user and their group. These methods provide flexible strategies for automated assignment, and their detailed definitions can be found in the ClaimCenter Rules Guide.\n\nFor highly specialized or complex assignment logic that goes beyond the standard methods, ClaimCenter provides **Dynamic Assignment**. This advanced topic allows you to define custom assignment strategies.
