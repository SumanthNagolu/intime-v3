      "narrative": "To effectively tailor ClaimCenter to specific business needs, it's essential to grasp how the system manages its vast amounts of data. The **ClaimCenter data model** is the fundamental structure that defines how data is stored, retrieved, and utilized within the application. It's essentially a blueprint for the claims business data, visible and documented in the Data Dictionary.\n\nAt its core, the data model is built around **entities** and **typelists**. An **entity** defines a collection of attributes (like fields or properties) related to a specific object, such as a `Claim`, `Exposure`, or `Contact`. These entities can contain various types of data, including columns for direct values, type keys for predefined options, arrays for collections of related items, and foreign keys to link to other entities. For example, the `Activity` entity holds data specific to tasks, and it can relate to a `Claim`, `Exposure`, or `Matter` through these relationships.\n\n**Typelists**, on the other hand, are similar to reference or lookup tables. They define a set of code/value pairs, known as typecodes, which specify allowable values for certain fields. For instance, a claim's status might be stored as a reference to a typelist with values like 'draft', 'open', or 'closed'. This ensures data consistency and provides predefined options for users.",

      "narrative": "The **Claim** entity is the central hub of information in ClaimCenter; almost everything significant revolves around it. While the `Claim` entity itself holds basic data like `Loss Date`, `Reported Date`, `Assigned User`, and `Loss Cause`, much of its comprehensive detail is derived from its relationships with other entities.\n\nOne crucial related entity is **Contact**. This entity stores information about individuals, organizations, or vendors relevant to a claim, such as the insured, witnesses, or repair shops. Contacts are highly flexible, supporting multiple subtypes like `Person`, `Company`, and `Place` to categorize different types of parties involved. The `ABContact` data model in ContactManager, for instance, has a parallel in the core application's `Contact` entity hierarchy, with subtypes like `ABPerson`, `ABCompany`, and `ABPlace` further subtyped into specific roles like `ABAdjudicator` or `ABAutoRepairShop`.\n\nTo manage the potentially complex relationships between a `Contact` and a `Claim`, ClaimCenter uses the **ClaimContact** entity. A single `Contact` might have various roles on a claim (e.g., an injured party, a witness, or the reporter). The `ClaimContact` entity acts as a join table, allowing a single `Contact` to be associated with a claim in multiple ways. If a contact has several relationships to a claim, there will be multiple `ClaimContact` records, each defining a specific role or connection. This ensures that all interactions and roles are accurately tracked.",

      "heading": "Incidents and Exposures: Tracking Damages and Potential Payments",
      "narrative": "Beyond the core claim and contact information, ClaimCenter needs to track what was actually lost or damaged, and how potential payments are managed. This is where **Incidents** and **Exposures** come into play.\n\nAn **Incident** represents an item that was lost or damaged, such as an `Injury` to a person, `Property` damage, or a `Vehicle` involved in an accident. A single claim can involve multiple incidents. For example, a workers' compensation claim might include an `Injury` incident, `Lost Wages`, and other liabilities. Incidents are typically captured during the initial claim creation process, though additional details might be gathered later. They can belong to the insured or a third party, often involving liability coverage. The `Assessment` data model, for instance, shows that assessments are properties of the `Incident` entity, with related entities like `AssessmentSource`, `AssessmentLine`, and `AssessmentItem` capturing detailed information about damages and costs.\n\n**Exposures** are a critical mechanism for tracking the progress of each potential compensation payment for a loss. While a policy administration system might view 'exposures' as potential coverages, in ClaimCenter, an `Exposure` is specifically used to track possible payments. Each `Exposure` associates a claimant with a particular policy coverage and coverage subtype. For instance, an `Exposure` might track payments related to a specific injury under a medical coverage. This allows ClaimCenter to manage the financial aspects of each distinct part of a loss. The subrogation data model also highlights how `Exposure` relates to `SubrogationSummary` and `ExpectedRecovery` for tracking potential recoveries.",

      "heading": "Managing Activities, Reserves, Transactions, and Checks",
      "narrative": "Effective claim processing involves a series of tasks, financial allocations, and payments, all managed through specific entities in ClaimCenter.\n\n**Activities** are individual tasks required to process a claim. Each `Activity` can be assigned to a person and tracked to completion, even for work performed outside ClaimCenter. They store details about what needs to be done, who is responsible, and a history of completion. Common examples include contacting the insured, completing external documents, or adding investigation notes. Activities themselves don't store the results of the work, but rather the task itself. The `Activity` entity has foreign keys to `Claim`, `Exposure`, `Matter`, `ServiceRequest`, and `User`, and contains typekeys to typelists like `ActivityClass`, `ActivityStatus`, `ActivityType`, `ImportanceLevel`, and `Priority`.\n\n**Reserve lines** represent amounts of money set aside for expected payments related to a specific `Exposure`. Think of them as dedicated accounts for different aspects of an exposure. An `Exposure` can have one or more `Reserve Lines`; for example, a workers' compensation exposure might have separate reserve lines for medical payments and for a medical case manager. Adjusters can increase (credit) or decrease (debits) these reserves.\n\n**Transactions** track individual financial events, such as credits or debits to a `Reserve Line`. When an adjuster increases available reserves, it's a credit. When a payment is made against a reserve line, it's a debit. The total remaining reserve is the result of credits minus debits.\n\nFinally, the **Check** entity holds information specific to a payment. While named 'Check', it encompasses all forms of payment, including physical checks and electronic fund transfers (EFTs). It maintains details like `Pay To`, `GrossAmount`, `BankAccount`, and `CheckInstructions`, and is related to the `Transaction` and `ClaimContact` entities. The `EFTData` entity and `Check` entity both implement the `EFTDataDelegate` entity, and `Check.instant.etx` contains additional fields for instant checks.",

It provides the most comprehensive detail, including columns, typekeys, arrays, foreign keys, derived arrays, derived properties, and subtypes for each entity.\n*   The **Database view** focuses solely on non-virtual, or persistent, entities and their definitions.

      "narrative": "The Data Dictionary is an invaluable tool for understanding the intricate details of each entity and typelist in ClaimCenter. It clarifies how different parts of a claim, maintained across various entities, relate to one another. This detailed insight is crucial when deciding what fields can be added to a user interface screen, used in Business Rules, or exported for integration and reporting purposes.\n\nWhen you select an entity, the dictionary provides an **Entity header** that displays the entity's name, its corresponding database table (e.g., `Claim (cc_claim)`), and any **delegates** it uses. A delegate is an abstract entity that defines common fields and behaviors, such as `CCAssignable` for entities that can be assigned to users. This means entities like `Claim`, `Exposure`, `Activity`, and `Matter` all inherit assignment-related fields and methods by delegating to `CCAssignable`.\n\nIf an entity has a parent-child relationship, it will feature a **Subtypes list**. For example, the `Contact` entity has subtypes like `Company`, `Person`, and `Place`. These subtypes inherit all attributes from their supertype while also possessing their own specific attributes. The dictionary clearly lists these child subtypes and provides links to their individual definitions. The `ABContact` entity hierarchy, for instance, shows how `ABCompany` can be subtyped into `ABCompanyVendor`, which then has further subtypes like `ABAutoRepairShop` or `ABMedicalCareOrg`.\n\nFinally, the **Fields list** section details all properties on an entity, including columns, foreign keys, type keys, and virtual properties. Base application fields are typically shown in dark green, while custom extensions appear in dark blue. Virtual properties are identified by 'Derived property returning some data type'. A useful feature is the ability to 'Show user interface details', which links to a table showing which UI elements (screens, labels) use a specific property, aiding in UI customization and impact analysis.",
