When it generates an\nunderwriting issue, the transaction will not progress further. UW referral reasons are\noften manually created, cannot be approved, and are manually deleted (or through an\nAPI). UW referral reasons persist with the policy.\n\nUnderwriting issues are related to the transaction. When something is notable about this\ntransaction requiring the attention of underwriting. They are often automatically generated,\nand are usually automatically removed when the cause no longer exists.\n\nSooo ooo ooo Oooo oOoD\n\nLesson\nobjectives ¢ Explain and define the policy holds\n\nreview * Describe and work with the Underwriting\nReferral Reasons",
