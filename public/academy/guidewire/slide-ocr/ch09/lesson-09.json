Why?\n¢\n4\n¢\n\nThe correct answers are:\n\nThe actions.exit() method is not used; rather, the rule set exits when all transaction\nvalidation rules have been executed, in the order in which they appear in Studio.\n\nThis is because success (or failure) of one validation condition does not necessarily\nmean that another will not fail (or succeed). By running all the rules, ClaimCenter\nprovides a full list of any conditions that must be remedied before continuing.\n\nSS See eo ee oo ooo SoD\n\nLesson\nobjectives ¢ Describe the financial model in\nreview ClaimCenter\n\n¢ Write transaction validation rules\n\n| Student exercise\n\nAdding a record of note\n\n| Student exercise\n\nPayment matching reserve fraud\ndetection",
