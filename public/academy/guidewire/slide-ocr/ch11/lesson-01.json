external system for exchange rates on a\nschedule\n\n¢ May execute logic entirely within InsuranceSuite or interact with other systems\n\n¢ Anexternal system calling an InsuranceSuite API may trigger a batch process to\nrun\n\ni Integration Mechanism: Integration tables\n\nGF —f—a\n\n—\nGuidewire Database External\nApplication Tables System\n\nAn integration table is a database table that both

information\nexchange systems that use the\nInternet for direct application-to-\napplication interaction\n\n* Typically, exchange of information is\nsynchronous and blocking\n\n+ The process calling the API halts any\nfurther action until the API has responded\nto the request\n\n* Guidewire supports two types:\n\n+ RESTful (Representational State\nTransfer)\n\n+ SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)\n\n* InsuranceSuite applications can\n\nboth publish and/or consume web\nservices\n\n¢ Publish example below:\n\n+ lAccountAPI web service with doesexist\nmethod\n\nlAccountAPI External\nWeb
