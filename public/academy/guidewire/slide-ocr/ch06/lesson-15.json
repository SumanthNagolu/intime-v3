However, it may\nnot be identical to the policy\nthat was canceled. Let’s take\na look.\n\nPolicy reinstatement overview Gi\n\n¢ Areinstatement is a transaction that makes a canceled policy effective again\n¢ Apolicy is reinstated according to the charges in the reinstatement billing\ninstruction\n* The policy’s charges are not automatically restored to their pre-cancellation state\n¢ Reinstatement processing involves:\n\n¢ Ifa reinstatement charge can be matched to one or more invoice item snapshots,\nBillingCenter:\n\na) Uses snapshots to create invoices with bill dates and due dates ic\nthat match the pre-cancellation invoices I\nb) Places reinstatement invoice items on appropriate invoices\n* If BillingCenter cannot find a cancellation snapshot for the policy to be reinstated, it typically\nslices each reinstatement charge using payment plan settings\n\nA gap in coverage can occur Gi\n\nBillingCenter supports reinstatement with and without gap in coverage\n\npolicy effective date cancellation effective date policy expiration date\nNo gap in\ncoverage ia\nreinstatement\nC}\neffective date policy\npolicy effective date cancellation effective date policy expiration date\nGap in\ncoverage* iid\n* Not supported by all policy restatement cy\n\nadministration systems gap effective date policy\n\nQuestion G\n\n,— — What is the purpose of cancellation snapshots?\n\n¢\n¢\n4\n\n~- SSS 55555555 55=->=-=\n\nAnswer Gi\n\n,— — What is the purpose of cancellation snapshots?\n\n¢\noo Cancellation snapshots provide the means of restoring the policy to a state that is as\n\nclose to its original state as possible. Snapshots are needed because all planned\ninvoices were collapsed onto a single invoice during the cancellation.\n\n~- SSS 5S 555555 5-5 =--=\n\nDemonstration G\n\nTest reinstatement processing\n\nclick here\n\nNote: The demonstration opens a new tab in your browser.

Renewal charges are categorized by charge pattern\n\n2. Charges are sliced into invoice items according to the payment plan\n\n3. Invoices are created and invoice items are assigned to invoices based on item placement\ndates\n\nYou can override default renewal charge slicing by adding a payment plan override\n\n« For example, no down payment for renewals/new renewals\n\nPolicy rewrite overview Gi\n\nArewrite is a transaction that creates a new policy from an existing policy\nCommon reasons for policy rewrites are:\n* To correct a significant error that occurred during the initial submission of policy\n* To put a canceled policy with a coverage gap back in force\n\nA full-term rewrite replaces the entire term of the original policy\n\nAmid-term rewrite replaces a portion of the original term of the original policy\nRewrite processing is similar to policy issuance and renewal processing:\n\n1. Renewal charges are categorized by charge pattern\n\n2. Charges are sliced into invoice items according to the payment plan\n\n3. Invoices are created; invoice items are assigned to invoices based on item placement dates\n\nYou can override default rewrite charae slicing hv adding 3a navment nlan override\n\nQuestion G\n\n_— — Policyholders want to avoid being billed for a down payment when\n\nPa policies are renewed.
