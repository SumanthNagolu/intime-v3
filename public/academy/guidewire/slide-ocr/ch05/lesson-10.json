She specified\no three payees (and there were no joint payees or recurring payments).\n¢ Based on this information alone:\n\nA. Can you tell how many CheckSets there are? Yes. There is one.\n(Each iteration of the payment wizard creates one checkset.)\n\nB. Can you tell how many checks there are? Yes. There are three.\n(Unless there are joint payees, each payee has a separate check.\nUnless there are recurring checks, then for three payees, there\nmust be three checks.)\n\nc. Can you tell how many payment transactions there are? No. You can't\ntell. (The number of payment transactions is not tied to the\nnumber of payees.)\n\nSSS eee oe eo ooo e SoD\n\nQuestion\n\n,- — Acheck includes a $200 final payment from a $500 reserve line. Why\n¢ does ClaimCenter create a second transaction? What is the dollar\n\n“ amount of this transaction?\n\nSS oe ooo e eo oe ooooOoD\n\nGi\n\nAnswer ia\n\n,- — Acheck includes a $200 final payment from a $500 reserve line. Why\no does ClaimCenter create a second transaction? What is the dollar\n: amount of this transaction?\n\nThe second transaction is used to zero out the reserve line. The dollar amount of this\ntransaction will be -$300, since there is $300 remaining after the $200 payment\ntransaction.\n\nSSS eee oe eo ooo e SoD\n\nQuestion\n\n,~ — Inwhat status must a check be for a user to delete the check?\n\n¢\n4\n¢\n\nSS oe ooo e eo oe ooooOoD\n\nAnswer\n\n,~ — Inwhat status must a check be for a user to delete the check?\n¢\n4\n4\n\nAwaiting submission\n\nSSS eee oe eo ooo e SoD\n\nQuestion\n\n,7~ — Can you start the payment wizard when the claim is not at “ability to\n7 pay\"?
