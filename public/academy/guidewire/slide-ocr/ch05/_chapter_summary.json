It is uncommon\nto have a contact exist only in Address Book. The primary purpose for a contact in\nAddress Book is to have it associated with multiple claims, and if it is associated with\neven one claim, then the contact will also exist in ClaimCenter.\n\nSS Oooo D OOOO ODD oo\n\n--- ch05/lesson-13/slide-36.png ---\nQuestion\n\n_~ — What is the purpose of a contact role?\n\n4\n¢\n¢\n\nSSoopooD OOOO OD ooo\n\n--- ch05/lesson-13/slide-37.png ---\nAnswer\n\nae What is the purpose of a contact role?\n\n¢\n¢\n\nAcontact role identifies the relationship that the contact has with the claim (such as\ninsured, witness, doctor, and so on).\n\nSS Oooo D OOOO ODD oo\n\n--- ch05/lesson-13/slide-38.png ---\nQuestion\n\n,~ — Howcan you tell if a contact is linked or in sync?\n\n4\n¢\n¢\n\nSSoopooD OOOO OD ooo\n\n--- ch05/lesson-13/slide-39.png ---\nAnswer\n\n,~ — Howcan you tell if a contact is linked or in sync?\n\n4\n¢\n¢\n\nYou can tell whether a contact is linked and/or in sync by selecting the contact from\nthe Parties Involved — Contacts’ screen.
