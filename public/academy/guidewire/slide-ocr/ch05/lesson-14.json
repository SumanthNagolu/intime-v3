A user must have at least one role in order to be able to do anything in\nClaimCenter. A user who has broader responsibility than another user can be given\nadditional roles so that they are able to accomplish these responsibilities.\n\nSS Oooo D OOOO ODD oo\n\nQuestion\n\n,~ — How could you easily determine the number of roles that enable users to\n\now create matters?\n7\n\nSSoopooD OOOO OD ooo\n\nGi\n\nAnswer [a\n\n,~ — How could you easily determine the number of roles that enable users to\n¢ create matters?\n\n¢\n¢\n\nYou could view the create matter permission in the security dictionary to see which\nroles contain that permission. Note that this only works for the base product, because\nthe security dictionary will not update based on any changes that a project team or\nsecurity administrator makes to the roles.\n\nSS Oooo D OOOO ODD oo\n\nQuestion\n\n,~ — Agiven user appears on the access control list for claim 234-22-147282,\now but that user cannot view or edit the claim. How could this happen?\n\nSSoopooD OOOO OD ooo\n\nGi\n\nAnswer [a\n\n,~ — Agiven user appears on the access control list for claim 234-22-147282,\nra but that user cannot view or edit the claim. How could this happen?\n\nThe user probably lacks the system permission to view and/or edit claims. In order to\nview or edit a claim, the user must have the system permission and appear on the\nACL.\n\nSS Oooo D OOOO ODD oo\n\nQuestion\n\n,~ — Asecurity profile can specify criteria for three types of access. What are\now the three types of access?\n\nSSoopooD OOOO OD ooo\n\nGi\n\nAnswer\n\n,~ — Asecurity profile can specify criteria for three types of access. What are\nra the three types of access?\n\nOwn access, view access, edit access.\n\nSS Oooo D OOOO ODD oo\n\nGi\n\nQuestion\n\n_~ — Iwo different claims that use the same security profile can have two\n¢ completely different access control lists. Why?\n\n¢\n¢\n\nSSoopooD OOOO OD ooo\n\nGi\n\nAnswer [a\n\n_~ — Iwo different claims that use the same security profile can have two\n¢ completely different access control lists. Why?\n\n¢\n¢\n\nThe security profile generates a list of users based on the criteria. The users who meet\nthe criteria vary from claim to claim. For example, if a profile says only the claim owner\nand members of his group can view and edit the claim, then two claims will have\ndifferent access control lists if they are owned by users in different groups.\n\nSS Oooo D OOOO ODD oo\n\nLesson\nobjectives ¢ Describe the role of permissions in controlling\nreview user capabilities in ClaimCenter\n\nDescribe the use of roles in managing user\npermissions\n\n« Assign permissions to roles\n\n¢ Assign roles to users\n\n¢ Describe Access Control Lists (ACLs)",
