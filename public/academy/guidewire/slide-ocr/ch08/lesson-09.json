If the field is revisioned, it can be changed on the\naccount level even after the policy is bound. The information is updated on the\naccount and can be obtained by policies for future jobs.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\nQuestion G\n\n,- — lrue or false: Contact data is always synced to account during\n\noo submission and issuance.\n\n¢\n\nSS oe ee oe oe oo\n\nAnswer Gi\n\n,7- — lue or false: Contact data is always synced to account during\n\nFa submission and issuance\n\n¢\n\nTrue.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\nQuestion G\n\n,- — lrueor false: During a back dated policy change, contact data is copied\noo from policy to account.\n\nSS oe ee oe oe oo\n\nAnswer Gi\n\n,- — lrueor false: During a back dated policy change, contact data is copied\nFa from policy to account.\n\nFalse.

A user can decide whether to apply the changes or not at the account\nlevel. The changes must be applied manually.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\ni Student exercise\n\nConcepts of Revisioning Contact and Location\nInformation\n\ni Locations are shared\n\n¢ Location information is shared\nbetween accounts and policies\n\n¢ Benefits of sharing information are:\n* Avoiding data re-entry and errors\n\n* Allowing the same location to be used on\nmultiple policies\n\nGi\n\nlame Account\nLocation |\n\nLocation\n\nPolicy\n\nlate\n\ni Information can change Gi\n\nPolicyCenter supports sharing and revisioning information\n\n¢ Revision: Information that is part of policy contract on an issued PolicyPeriod\nshould be revisioned\n\n* Sometimes we are interested in information as it was at a given point in time\n* When a Policy is issued, we want to keep a version of it at that point in time\n* It can change anytime a job is executed on it\n\n¢ Share: Information can be kept at the Account level so it can be shared, to avoid\nduplication\n\n* Sometimes we are interested in most up-to-date contact info\n\ni Location information Gi\n\nLocation information includes:\n\n¢ Basic location information such as address, city and state location name and\nphone\n\n* Policy-specific information such as tax location\n\ni Location revisioning\n\nlimi Locations are shared cr\n\nAccount location Policy location revisioned\n(field by field)\n\n* Location information is stored at account and policy levels\n¢ Location information is revisioned on a field-by-field basis\n* Configuration user can define what information to revision\n¢ Location information that is part of policy contract is revisioned\n\n¢ In draft jobs, policy and account location information is always synchronized\n\ni Changing account location information Gi\n\nChanging account location information affects:\n\n* Pending Policy Transactions — these policy transactions always display up-to-\ndate account level information\n\n* Quoted Policy Transactions — a policy transaction is quoted but not bound and a\nrevisioned field on account location changed, a validation error occurs at bind time\nand it needs to requote\n\n* Bound Policies or Completed Policy Transactions — each bound policy\ntransaction gets copy of synchronized location information at time of binding\n\n¢ New Policy Transactions — locations on these policy transactions always display\nthe current location information\n\ni Location configuration\n\n* Location related entities that can be extended are:\n\n* PolicyLocation\n\n* AccountLocation\n\n* Line of business specific locations such as BOPLocation, IMLocation, and CPLocation\n¢ User can configure:\n\n« Which fields are revisioned on PolicyLocation or AccountLocation\n\n* On which jobs and when location information is synchronized\n\nExample: revisioned location fields\n\nPolicyLocation\nAddressL1 (synced)\n\nAddressL2 (synced)\nCity (synced)\nState (synced)\n\nLocationNum\n\nA—>B A has foreignkey to B\nA—>B Aextends B\n—B Ahas 0 or more Bs\n\nLesson\nobjectives ¢« Describe the shared and revisioned data\nreview between account and policy\n\n¢ Describe future dated, back dated, and\ncurrent dated contact behavior\n¢ Explain revisioned location information",

If the field is revisioned, it can be changed on the\naccount level even after the policy is bound.
