A step\n’ ?\n¢\n\nYou might put steps into a step set when you want to control the visibility or availability\nof multiple steps with a single condition. You might put steps into a step group when\nyou want the steps to be indented with a single label displayed over all of them.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\nQuestion G\n\n_~ — What attribute controls the order of appearance of job wizard steps in the\no user interface?\n\nSS oe ee oe oe oo\n\nAnswer G\n\n,~ — What attribute controls the order of appearance of job wizard steps in the\noo user interface?\n\nThere is no attribute that controls the order of appearance. Order of appearance is\nbased on the order in which the wizard steps are listed in the PCF file.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\nQuestion G\n\nae ee does a step behave differently if you set its independent attribute to\n, ?\n¢\n\nSS oe ee oe oe oo\n\nAnswer G\n\nae tae does a step behave differently if you set its independent attribute to\n’ ?\n¢\n\nSetting a step’s independent attribute to true will list it at the bottom of the sidebar, and\nit cannot be navigated to using the Back/Next toolbar buttons.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\nQuestion G\n\n,~ — What is a job wizard's entry point?
