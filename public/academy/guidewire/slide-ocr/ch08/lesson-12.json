In\nsecondary assignment, one or more users are assigned to roles with respect to the\nassigned object.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\nQuestion G\n\n,~ — When an activity is assigned by rules, which two rule sets are typically\noo executed? In what order?\n\nSS oe ee oe oe oo\n\nAnswer Gi\n\n,~ — When an activity is assigned by rules, which two rule sets are typically\nFa executed? In what order?\n\nFirst, global rules are executed. Then, default group rules are executed.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\nQuestion G\n\n,~ — Under what circumstances can an activity be assigned without\n\noo assignment rules being executed?\n\n¢\n\nSS oe ee oe oe oo\n\nAnswer\n\n,~ — Under what circumstances can an activity be assigned without\n\nFa assignment rules being executed?\n\n¢\n\nWhen the activity is assigned to a specific user.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\nQuestion G\n\n,- — Why are assignment methods always inside i‘ statements in assignment\n\n7 rules?\n0 ! ’\n7\n\nSS oe ee oe oe oo\n\nAnswer Gi\n\n,- — Why are assignment methods always inside i statements in assignment\nFa rules?\n¢\n\nAssignment methods are always inside if statements because they might fail. For\nexample, an assignGroup method may not be able to find the specified group.\n\nIf the assignment succeeds, then the if statement causes control of flow to execute an\nactions.exit() statement, which exits execution from the rule set.\n\nIf the assignment fails, then the actions.exit() statement is skipped and execution\nproceeds to the next rule.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\nQuestion G\n\n,~ — What is the Default Owner of an object?\n\n¢\n4\n¢\n\nSS oe ee oe oe oo\n\nAnswer Gi\n\n,~ — What is the Default Owner of an object?\n¢\n4\n¢\n\nDefault Owner is a dummy user that objects are assigned to when global assignment\nrules fail to assign the object to a group.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo\n\nLesson\nobj ectives ¢ Describe primary assignment\nreview * Assign an activity\n\ni Student exercise\n\nAssigning Activities",
