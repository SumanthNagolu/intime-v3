A Rate book consists of data from the rate tables and rate routines. The rate routines use the parameter sets which provides the data needed for calculations in the rating algorithm. The line specific rating engine class creates the CostData objects in memory, looks up the rate factors from the rate books, populates the parameter set map to be passed in to the rate routines and executes the rate routines to store the calculated amount in the CostData objects temporarily. Eventually the rating engine merges the CostData objects to create the Cost entities, which are persisted in the database- The details about the rate books, rate tables, rate routines and parameter sets at the IJI level are covered in the PolicyCenter Rating Introduction course.",
