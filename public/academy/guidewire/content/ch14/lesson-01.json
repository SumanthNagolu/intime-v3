The Rating engine first calls the PCRatingPlugin which instantiates the LOB specific rating class, if you have Guidewire Rating Management configured for that LOB. For example, PARatingEngine is instantiated for a Personal Auto policy- PARatingEngine.gs calculates the premium by using the methods defined in the AbstractRatingEngine and the CostData class.  In the base application, only the Personal Auto and Commercial Property lines of business have their own rating engine configured using Guidewire Rating Management.  PolicyCenter default configuration provides two implementations of IRatingPlugin.  SysTableRatingPlugimgs and PCRatingPlugin-gs.  The SysTableRatingPlugin has a default rating engine for all LOBs- PCRatingPlugin has a rating engine for PA  (PARatingEngine) and CP ( CPRatingEngine) which uses the rate tables to lookup rate factors-\nThis lesson assumes that in case of a Personal Auto line of business you have the Rating Management license, and the default rating engine is configured to use the PCRatingPlugin-gs.",
