If a change is made to a policy where a new vehicle or driver is added on the policy, the policy needs to be re-rated in slice mode. This is because say 3 months from the policy’s effective date has already passed. So, cost objects on that time will have different rates than the cost objects after the change transaction which added new objects or the rates for existing cost objects could have also changed if a new rate book is made available- Coverage costs are linear. For example, a coverage for 6 months costs $600 that is, $100 per month- So, if you buy the coverage for 3 months it costs $300 and for 1 year it will cost $1200.  It increases with effective time of the policy",
