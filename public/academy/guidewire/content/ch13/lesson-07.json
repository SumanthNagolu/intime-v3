The new PolicyPeriod has only one slice, which is the full-term equivalent of the original PolicyPeriod last slice. Once the periods are selected, then the plugin creates test versions of the quote using baseline periods that are similar to multi-version policies by cloning the baseline periods. The user has to select which rate books to use for rating the test policies. After the rate books are selected, the impact results are displayed.",
