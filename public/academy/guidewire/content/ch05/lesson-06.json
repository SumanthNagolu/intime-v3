The data is logically grouped into objects called entities. Each entity maintains fields or properties specific to group of data it represents. For example, the activity entity maintains data pertaining to activities. It also maintains relationships to other entities, as needed. An activity may be related to a claim, exposure or a matter. These relationships provide ClaimCenter the ability to use data from multiple entities in a meaningful way.\n\nA typelist is similar to a reference or lookup table in other applications. For example, every claim has a status, which is stored as a reference to a typelist, whose values include draft, open, and closed.",
