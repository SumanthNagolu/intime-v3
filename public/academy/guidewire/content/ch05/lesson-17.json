Therefore, the two coverages (Liability and Collision) are mapped to a single ExposureType (vehicle damage), and it is this ExposureType which is used to govern the type of information gathered during the claims process.\n\nSimilarly, a single coverage may cover multiple categoriesof loss. In this scenario, the coverage type will associate with multiple exposure types.

If the insurer uses Guidewire Policy Center, there is a utility that will help build the Claim Center Line of Business model. The utility, Claim Center Type List Generator, synchronizes the Claim Center line of business model with the Policy Center product model. The utility creates the Claim Center Line of Business model from a similar model in Policy Center.\n\nThe Claim Center Line of Business model uses some data definitions from Policy Center. The Policy Center Policy Line Pattem maps to the Claim Center Line of Business; the Policy Center Product maps to the Claim Center Policy Type; and the Policy Center Coverage Pattern maps to the Claim Center Coverage Type.  Claim Center LossTypes,  Exposure Types, and Coverage Subtypes are Claim Center-specific and do not map to anything in Policy Center.",
