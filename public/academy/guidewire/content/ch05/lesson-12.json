      "originalNotes": "Constraining claim costs payments\nIn ClaimCenter, there are two ways to constrain, or restrict, payments; maturity levels and financial holds. Maturity levels prevent all payments both claim costs and claim expenses. Maturity levels are data-driven which means there are conditions set on the completeness of data that the claim and exposures must meet before they are moved to the ability to pay level. For example, there could be a condition that restricts ability to pay on an exposure until the driver's license of the payee is recorded.\nThere are also some business based conditions that affect payments. If a insurer is unsure that the claim is for a covered event, then they would not want to pay claim costs. The same would be true if they were unsure that the event occurred while the policy was in force or if they could not verify the policy. Any of those business conditions should prevent claim costs being paid, but not claim expenses. This type of restriction is covered by financial holds.",
