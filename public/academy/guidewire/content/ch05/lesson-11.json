For example, if there is a limit that specifies the payment amount limit at SIO,OOO, any payment transaction over that limit will require transaction approval.\n\nThe second restriction is that users may be limited to what they can create. For a user to create any reserve transaction, they must have at least one authority limit for reserves. If they don’t have any authority limit on reserves, like claim total reserves or claim available reserves, they can't create any reserve transaction. This restriction keeps them from creating a transaction, without any regard to approval limits, they simply cannot create the transaction\nFor example, if there is only an authority limit for a Workers’ Comp policy type, the user can only create transactions for that policy type.\nIn most cases the menu options to create the forbidden transaction are missing.

      "originalNotes": "Transaction approval rules\nTransaction approval rules use GOSIJ code and are a configuration level solution.  Because they are code-based,  they are more complex than authority limits, however they do cover a wide range of conditions.  Fundamentally, if it can be tested with code, it can be in a transaction approval rule.\n\nThese rules can be used when the condition to be tested is more complicated or uses attributes beyond policy type, coverage type, and cost type. They are also useful if the condition applies to all users instead of a group of users, like adjuster, supervisors,  and so on.\n\nFor example, when the segmentation of an exposure or claim is low complexity, and the total reserves is greater than $30,000 then the insurer wants to require additional approval. This would prevent a seemingly low complexity claim (like a windshield break, or minor claim)  from having reserves that are high for that type of claim. If those conditions are true, then the transaction would require approval.",

Because they are code-based,  they are more complex than authority limits, however they do cover a wide range of conditions.  Fundamentally, if it can be tested with code, it can be in a transaction approval rule.\n\nThese rules can be used when the condition to be tested is more complicated or uses attributes beyond policy type, coverage type, and cost type. They are also useful if the condition applies to all users instead of a group of users, like adjuster, supervisors,  and so on.\n\nFor example, when the segmentation of an exposure or claim is low complexity, and the total reserves is greater than $30,000 then the insurer wants to require additional approval. This would prevent a seemingly low complexity claim (like a windshield break, or minor claim)  from having reserves that are high for that type of claim. If those conditions are true, then the transaction would require approval.",
