You can see these when adding a new claim or exposure- Based on the line of business presented or selected, you will have different options.\n\nThe structure of the Line of Business is defined in six distinct typelists:\n\nLossType is a broad industry category for P&C insurance activity. A claim's Loss Type helps determine the IJI elements to use or display. For example, the New Claim Wizard has a Loss Details screen. Details about the injured worker's employment data and injuries appear in the IJI only when the LossType is Worker's Comp.  The LOB (line of business)  level splits the LossType into more granular levels for reporting purposes- This level is used for reporting and management by a carrier and can roughly be seen as business units. A given LossType may have many Lines of Business associated with it. \n\nPolicy Type defines the types of policies the insurer sells- A policy is a product that is sold to customers and that promises to pay money when a specified LossType occurs. In the base configuration, the only Policy Type under the Workers' Comp LOB is the Workers' Comp policy, but one LOB may have many Policy Types..\n\nA Coverage Type (CovType) defines specific items that the carrier will indemnify as part of the policy contract- A Policy Type can include many CoverageTypes-\n\nExposure Typeis a set of information needed for a given exposure during claims processing.
