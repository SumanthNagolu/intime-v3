For example, create group is a static permission meaning that a user with that permission can always create a group without any restriction. Static permissions are granted across the entire application and are an all-or-none approach.\n\nCreate exposure is an object- based permission because it does not use an all-or-none approach. A user with create exposure permissions can create exposures only on those claims to which they have access. For example, an auto adjuster does not have access to workers’ comp claims and therefore cannot create exposures on workers' comp claims, regardless of having the create exposure permission.\n\nFor a user to create an exposure, they must have the create exposure permission and have access to the claim.
