Therefore, each user must belong to at least one group.\n\nGroups\nThe basic way ClaimCenter organizes a carrier's employees, the people available to handle claims, is through groups. A group's members can either be other groups—teams or subgroups—or users, people who work on claims. Groups are often defined to mirror the carrier’s organizational structure—a main offce has departments that contain divisional offices that control local offices, and so on. But groups can also be defined virtually. A vittual group is a set of people who are not part of the same team or department, but who are related in some other way. For example, a virtual group could contain all adjusters in a large region with expertise in commercial arson. The members do normal work in different local offices and are members of their own office groups as well.",

      "notes": "When and how does assignment occur?\nAssignment generally occurs when an object is created. For example, at the end of the New Claim Wizard, the user has the option to let ClaimCenter use the rules to assign the claim, or they can assign the claim manually.\n\nAn existing object can be reassigned when the owner, or someone with sufficient permissions, explicitly chooses to reassign the object. Just as at initial creation, the new owner can be specified explicitly or can be chosen automatically through the assignment rules\n\nIn the base application, the owner of an object and their supervisor can reassign an object. For example, the owner of the claim can reassign any exposures on the claim. During automated claim setup or claim creation, the claim itself is assigned to a groupand a user. Any activities and exposures that are created during that process are also assigned to a group and user.",
