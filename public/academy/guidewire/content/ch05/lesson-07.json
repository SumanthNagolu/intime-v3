      "originalNotes": "Determine Compensability on workers' compensation claims\nThe purpose of this step in WC claim processing is to decide on whether or not the claim is compensable (payable). This is usually one of the first tasks that adjusters take on when working on a WC claim, due to its time-sensitive nature. Determining compensability is also referred to as \"claim acceptance“\n\n The Compensability Decision is one of the most important (and cost-saving) components of WC claim processing. Many state laws and other regulations dictate that if a carrier does not respond or accept a claim within a particular time window, the claim is automatically compensable. Furthermore, cases of fraud andfor injuries sustained outside of employment could be pinpointed and the claim denied as a result- Each jurisdiction may have different amounts of time for determining compensability. This is known as the \"Denial Period\". For example, the state of Illinois (IL) mandates that the carrier must make a compensability decision within three days of the loss date. The state of  Connecticut (CT) gives twenty-eight calendar days for the decision. Jurisdictional details such as the logic determining when claim acceptance is due (the compensability due date), which jurisdictions are configured, and document templates to communicate letters of claim acceptance or denying a claim are available for users with the appropriate permissions (and access to the Administration screen). Administration of this \"Denial Period\" for jurisdictions is covered in the \"Workers’ Comp: Administering ClaimCenter\" lesson. Depending on your configuration, the 'Determine Compensability\" activity may or may not be created on imported claims, or on sample data claims.",
