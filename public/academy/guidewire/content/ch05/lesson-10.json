It contains both credits and debits, and its size is equal to the credits minus the debits. It is money set aside for payments that are expected related to a specific exposure.\n\nThere is no technical requirement for an exposure to have a reserve line. You can create and even close exposures without creating reserve lines. However, you cannot make payments to claimants without reserve lines attached to an exposure.\n\nReserve lines are defined by the exposure, cost type, and the cost category. An exposure may have multiple reserve lines.\n\nIn this example, the exposure on the Medical Details coverage for Jim Means has two separate reserve lines; one for the Claim Cost with a category of Medical, and the second for Claim Expense with a category of Case management.",
