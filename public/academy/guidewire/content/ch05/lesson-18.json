A contact exists in ContactManager when the contact is used or is expected to be used for multiple claims. This is typically true for person vendors such as doctors,  company vendors such as hospitals, or venues such as courts. Because there is a need for contact information to be shared across multiple claims,  the contact is stored in ContactManager. When the contact is used on a claim, ClaimCenter keeps a local copy of any of those shared contacts.  In this example Dr. Sawyer is a doctor that is a shared contact,  which means he have may roles on multiple claims. He exists in both ClaimCenter and ContactManager. Because he is maintained in ContactManager and has a role on this claim, the two records are linked. Tanya Fan has a role on a claim but is not a shared contact. She is known to only ClaimCenter and therefore is not linked to ContactManager",
