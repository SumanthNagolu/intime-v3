The most common type is where some third party is suing the policyholder, or where an injured worker sues their employer (also known as ZEmployer Liability\"). Because the insurer will end up paying the settlement in the case of an unfavorable judgment, the insurer generally retains the right to conduct the defense. In a smaller number of cases, the insurer will be sued directly by the policyholder or a claimant. A subset of these first-party suits are \"bad faith\" lawsuits, in which the claimant alleges that the insurer did not handle the claim fairly; bad faith suits are an important reason why insurers want to have consistent claim handling practices and the ability to document what they do on a claim.\nIn most cases, the actual defense will be entrusted to an external defense attorney, often supervised by an internal attorney. In some cases, the defense will be managed by an internal attorney.",
      "notes": "Litigation issues\nA small number of claims go into litigation, but they tend to be the largest in dollar value. The most common type is where some third party is suing the policyholder, or where an injured worker sues their employer (also known as ZEmployer Liability\"). Because the insurer will end up paying the settlement in the case of an unfavorable judgment, the insurer generally retains the right to conduct the defense. In a smaller number of cases, the insurer will be sued directly by the policyholder or a claimant. A subset of these first-party suits are \"bad faith\" lawsuits, in which the claimant alleges that the insurer did not handle the claim fairly; bad faith suits are an important reason why insurers want to have consistent claim handling practices and the ability to document what they do on a claim.\nIn most cases, the actual defense will be entrusted to an external defense attorney, often supervised by an internal attorney. In some cases, the defense will be managed by an internal attorney.",
