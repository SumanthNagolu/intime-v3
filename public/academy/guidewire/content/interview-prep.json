Some readers may be unaware that the rules are different for different nations/contents. For example, the 2005 daylight savings time starts in the United States on April 3, but in Egypt on April 29. It is also important to know that not only the dates are different for different locals, but the time of the shift is different as well. Many places shift at 2:00 am, but others shift time at 1:00 am, others at 3:00 am, and still others right at midnight.",

As such, it has to do nothing in particular with respect to daylight savings time in order to \"stay on schedule\" - it simply keeps firing every N milliseconds. Regardless your SimpleTrigger is firing every 10 seconds, or every 15 minutes, or every hour or every 24 hours it will continue to do so. However the implication of this which confuses some users is that if your SimpleTrigger is firing say every 12 hours, before daylight savings switches it may be firing at what appears to be 3:00 am and 3:00 pm, but after daylight savings 4:00 am and 4:00 pm. This is not a bug - the trigger has kept firing exacly every N milliseconds, it just that the \"name\" of that time that humans impose on that moment has changed.",

However, depending on whether it was the Spring or Autumn daylight savings event, for that particular Sunday, the actual time interval between the firing of the trigger on Sundary morning at 10:00 am since its firing on Saturday morning at 10:00 am will not be 24 hours, but will instead be 23 or 25 hours respectively.",

This is that you should take careful thought about creating schedules that fire between midnight and 3:00 am (the critical window of time depends on your trigger's locale, as explained above). The reason is that depending on your trigger's schedule, and the particular daylight event, the trigger may be skipped or may appear to not fire for an hour or two. As examples, say you are in the United States, where daylight savings events occur at 2:00 am. If you have a CronTrrigger that fires every day at 2:15 am, then on the day of the beginning of daylight savings time the trigger will be skipped, since, 2:15 am never occurs that day. If you have a CronTrigger that fires every 15 minutes of every hour of every day, then on the day daylight savings time ends you will have an hour of time for which no triggerings occur, because when 2:00 am arrives, it will become 1:00 am again, however all of the firings during the one o'clock hour have already occurred, and the trigger's next fire time was set to 2:00 am - hence for the next hour no triggerings will occur.",

Not only does the system tracks claims, but it also records the finances associated with each claim or exposure. This means that you can create reserves for claims, make payments, and create recovery reserves.\nExample:\nAn adjuster receives a claim for an auto accident, and as part of the claim process, the adjuster creates several exposures and the reserves that are affiliated with each exposure. There is a reserve line for potential auto damage costs and a reserve line to estimate medical costs of an injured driver. These reserve lines allow the adjuster to track each type of potential payment. Payments consist of transactions. As these costs become clear, the adjuster approves these payments and issues checks against these reserves. This action decreases the reserves.\nThe adjuster readjusts reserve levels and then determines that another driver was at fault. The adjuster then creates a recovery reserve for the amount expected from that driver’s insurance carrier. After the carrier sends the adjuster a check, the adjuster notes this amount as a recovery, which decreases the claim’s recovery reserve.\nTo manage these financial tasks, ClaimCenter uses these main concepts:\nI have designed the screens for financials and made some changes to the base financial entity as per the requirement or JIRA .",

You can also use rules to execute validation behavior at a global level when the error might not\nrelate to one specific field. For example, a carrier allows up to five vehicles to be covered on a single personal\nauto policy. The underwriter enters five automobiles. The business data is invalid, but there is not any one\nfield that is causing the error.\nWe have 2 types of validations\nEntity level validation\nField level validation",

          "answer": "There are two validation levels common to nearly every carrier (\"new loss completion\" and \"ability to pay\". The intermediate levels vary from carrier to carrier.\nIn the base application, there are five levels of maturity:\nLoad save - This is the level a claim must be at in order to be imported from an external system. A claim at this stage has not yet been touched by a user via ClaimCenter. (This level is relevant only for imported FNOLs.)\nNew loss completion - This is the level a claim must be at to be saved (or modified by a user if the claim is imported).\nValid for ISO - This level is used to signify that the claim has the minimal information needed for filing with ISO.\nSend to external (systems) - This level is used to signify that the claim has the minimal information needed to send information about it to external systems within the carrier, such as a policy administration system which is trying to assess policy renewal rates.\nAbility to pay - This is the level a claim must be at in order to have payments written against it.\nThe Valid for ISO and Send to external (systems) levels are configurable. The other three levels are internal levels required by ClaimCenter and cannot be modified. You can also add additional levels not found in the base application.\nClaimCenter uses \"validation levels\" to measure how mature a claim and its exposures are\nEvery level has a series of conditions that a claim or exposure must meet in order to reach that level\nNote:  Refer to the claim processing ppt for more detailed answer to the above question",

You can use this feature to trigger actions or update related data when the property value changes. Reflection, on the other hand, is a programming concept that enables you to inspect and manipulate objects, classes, and metadata at runtime. In Guidewire, you can use reflection to access and modify properties, call methods, and create objects dynamically.",

First, design the custom exception class to include relevant information, such as noise level thresholds or specific components causing excessive noise. Then, modify the production process to identify noise-related issues and throw the custom exception when necessary. Finally, implement exception handling in the code to address noise issues when they occur, such as adjusting manufacturing parameters or notifying engineers to inspect the problematic components.",

Asynchronous processes, on the other hand, run in the background without blocking further execution, allowing other tasks to continue concurrently.\nExamples:\n- Synchronous process: A user triggers an action that updates claim information and immediately displays the updated information to the user. The user must wait for the process to complete before continuing.\n- Asynchronous process: A user triggers a long-running operation, such as a batch job or a message to an external system. The operation is queued and executed in the background, allowing the user to continue working on other tasks without waiting for the operation to complete.",

Payment - Once the loss has been assessed and the payment has been approved, the carrier can  provide the payments to the claimants. The payment phase involves creating, approving, and  issuing the checks.\nd. Recovery - In some cases, the carrier may also attempt to recover funds paid to the claimant by  obtaining money from a third party's carrier if the third party was at fault (which is known as  \"subrogation\") or by taking possession of a significantly damaged property and selling all or  parts of it to a third party (which is known as \"salvage\").\n***Litigation, Fraud detection and Special Investigations - This is typically a process which is  ongoing throughout every phase of the claims process.",

          "answer": "deductible : A deductible is an amount of money that the insured must pay out of pocket for a loss. The  carrier provides payment only for the amount above and beyond the deductible.\nSensitivity: Confidential\nSensitivity: Confidential\nA check can potentially go through several statuses during its life cycle.\n• Initially, a check is in a draft state while it is being created within the payment wizard. • When a check is initially created, the check's status is set to \"Pending Approval\".  • If the approval is denied, then the check is set to \"Rejected\".\n• If the approval is approved, or if no approval is required, the check advances to  \"Awaiting Submission\" status. At this point, it has not yet been sent to the\nexternal check printing system.\n• A periodic batch process sends checks at \"awaiting submission\" status to the check  printing system. Once sent to the check printing system, its status is \"Requesting\" or  \"Requested\". (The exact status can depend on the implementation of the integration  code.)\n• When the check printing system reports that the check has been issued, the status  changes to \"Issued\".\n• When the payee(s) have cashed the check, it is \"Cleared\".\nThe \"Pending Approval\", \"Rejected\", and \"Awaiting Submission\" statuses are managed by ClaimCenter.  The external check printing system largely manages the latter three steps, identifying that the check has  been received, printed, and then cashed.\npostOnChange is a boolean widget property that causes the widget to \"announce\" any changes to its  value\n- Triggers re-evaluation of other widget conditions\n- Involves call to application server\nIf you want change in given widget to immediately trigger re-evaluation of other widget properties, set  given widget's postOnChange to true\nReflection involves a \"trigger widget\" and one or more \"listening widgets\"\n- When change occurs in trigger widget, listening widgets reflect change\nGuidewire Profiler screen provides access to a set of tools that are useful in gathering and  analyzing information on the runtime behavior and performance of Guidewire ClaimCenter.  The Profiler records the time spent in specific processing areas done by the application code,  as well as the configured rules and PCF screens. Use of this information can help narrow  down issues to the potentially problematic components such as PCF screens, rules, code  sections, or workflows.\nSensitivity: Confidential\nProfiler code is useful, for example, to record the following types of operations and  information:\n• SQL statements that ClaimCenter is executing\n• Parameters passed to those SQL statements\n• Row counts\n• Name of the currently executing rule\nGuidewire recommends that you exercise care in using this feature. Storing too much  information can cause the Profiler screen to become too cluttered, require more space for  storage and, for long-running processes, hold on to too much memory at runtime.\nEntity : A data model entity is an abstract definition of a group of business objects used by the  application Examples: Contact, User\nA foreign key field stores a reference to a related object in the data model\nAn array key field stores references to a set of related objects in the data model. Array keys are not  stored in database. Array keys are managed during run-time by code that queries the database for the  appropriate set of objects.\nA typelist is a predefined list of values that constrains a field\nAn edge foreign key lets either: An entity reference itself, or Two or more entities reference each other\nGuidewire has two types of delegates: data model delegates and Gosu delegates. A data model  delegate is a virtual entity consisting of database fields and/or methods that can be reused by multiple  concrete data model entities. Like a delegate in Java, a Gosu delegate is a Gosu object that provides  method invocations for an interface implemented on some other Gosu object. This lesson does not  discuss Gosu delegates. It discusses only the EventAware data model delegate, and any unqualified use  of the word \"delegate\" should be understood to mean \"data model delegate\".\nSafe ordering - Its primary purpose is to ensure that the external system gets related messages one at a  time. The external system must acknowledge the first message before the next message is sent\nThis allows Guidewire to send messages as soon as possible, and yet prevents errors that might occur if  related messages were processed out of order.\nSafe ordering is not a simple first-in first-out order (FIFO). Messages are sent based on the order in  which they must be received by the external system, which may or may not be identical to the order in  which they were created in Event Fired rules.\nDifference between non safe and safe ordering messages:\n- Non-safe ordering messages are sent first...\n- In the order they are created\n- Immediately\nSensitivity: Confidential\n- Safe-ordering messages are sent afterwards...\n- In the order they are created\n- But for each entity, only one message is sent at a time\nA Guidewire bundle is a set of in-memory entities that are saved to the database as a unit. Each bundle  corresponds to one database transaction. \"Committing a bundle\" means saving all entities in the bundle  to the database\nRules order:",

What we have done is instead of creating  two column structure for all the pages in UI which is default in OOTB application we changed that into single column structure.. that’s what the user wanted …so we created the pages using a single column… the reason for it is sometimes the width is too much because of which the user has to drag the navigational box.. so they wanted to create a single column which we did. we did modify almost all UI pages. we required an extensive modification on the pages.",

This logic is written is some utility functions and in addition to this I have written couple of enhancements to incidents , enhancements to exposure and some enhancements to claim . so those enhancements are called by my application which I did. And I am also involved in peer code review , In my team I review the code of my colleagues and they review my code.. we call it a peer code review and we do it every two weeks and once peer code review is done the peer code reviews review comments will be implemented on the following day.. normally on Fridays.. final code review is done by team lead",
