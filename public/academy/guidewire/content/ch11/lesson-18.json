      "originalNotes": "What is a batch process?\nBy default, batch processes do all their work on the batch server within a single process. If the Guidewire application is installed as a cluster, then you can distribute the work of process- intensive tasks across multiple servers. The mechanism that manages the distribution of work is called a work queue (or sometimes a distributed work queue). In a Guidewire cluster, worker processes can run in parallel on multiple servers.  Worker processes are not restricted to running on the batch server. The batch process that supports workers is a writer. A writer is a schedulable batch process that runs only on the batch server. A writer loads a queue with work items to be completed by one or more workers. Together, the arrangement of workers, a writer, and a queue make up a distributed work queue. Distributed work queues have an advantage because multiple servers in a cluster can share processing. Each work queue concerns itself with a specific task. For more information on distributed work queues, refer to the application's System Administration Guide. Batch processes are documented in each application's System Administration Guide.",
