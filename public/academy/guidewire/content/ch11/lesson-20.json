      "notes": "Sending events from InsuranceSuite in Guidewire Cloud\nAlthough event messaging is still available to develop outbound integrations in Guidewire cloud - App Events is its successor and is the recommended way of implementing outbound event-based integrations in the cloud. App Events should be used when building new outbound integrations in the cloud.\n\nApp Events is a no-code mechanism for outbound event publishing. Developers use a form-like interface called Webhooks IJI to push events from ClaimCenter and PolicyCenter to external systems.\n\nThe slide shows four use cases:\n\nA medical bill review system needs to know when claims and medical exposures are created to provide context for evaluating medical bills.\nA fraud scoring system needs to know when there is activity on a claim to trigger fraud scoring. \nA fraud scoring system needs to know when there are policy lifecycle related events to keep its data up to date.\nA vehicle estimates system needs to know when a claim is created to calculate estimatedamage cost for a vehicle\n\nIn self-managed implementations, each of these integrations would require several lines of Gosu code. Implementing, testing,deploying, and maintaining this code is complex. With App Events, a developer working on implementing any of the use cases mentioned above would create a subscription using the Webhooks IJI to send events downstream.
