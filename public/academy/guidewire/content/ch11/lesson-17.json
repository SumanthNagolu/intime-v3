In most cases, an authentication scenario includes having a user log into a Guidewire application via a web form login page. Another common scenario is for an external system to log into a Guidewire application via a SOAP web service API. Similarly, Guidewire applications often integrate and share data with third party databases. In order to do so, the Guidewire application must itself be authenticated.",

Credentials are passed to plugin — The DefaultAuthenticationSou rceCreatorPlugin extracts the request's credentials- Guidewire externalizesthe logic for extracting the login information from the initial request and placing it in a structured credential object. This plugin creates the Authentication Source object from information in an HTTPRequest from the browser and returns it to Guidewire.\n3. Server requests authentication — Guidewire passes the Authentication Source object to the Default Authentication ServicePIugin, which is responsible for determining whether or not to permit the user to log in.\n4. External service verifies credentials — The Default Authentication Ser vice Piug in only checks the provided username and password against information stored in Guidewire's database. However, a custom implementation of the plugin can also check against an external authentication service such as a corporate LDAP directory or a single sign-on system (SSO).\n5. Database verifies credentials — If the user’s credential is verified successfully by the external service, the Authentication Service plugin will use a callback handler to look up the user's PubliclD from Guidewire's database.\n6.
