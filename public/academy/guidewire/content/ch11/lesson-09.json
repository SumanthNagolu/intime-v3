The advantage of using a Document style model is that you can structure the SOAP body any way you want it as long as the content of the SOAP message body is any arbitrary XML instance. The Document style is also referred to as Message- Oriented style-\n\nFurthermore, there are two encoding use models that are used to translate a WSDL binding to a SOAP message-They are: literal, and encoded. When using a literal use model, the body contents should conform to a user-defined XML-schema(XSD) structure. The advantage is two-fold. For one, you can validate the message body with the user-defined XML-schema, moreover, you can also transform the message using a transformation language like XSLT\n\nThe combination of the different styde and use models give us four different ways to translate a WSDL binding to a SOAP message:\nDocument.literaI\nDocument/encoded\nRpcnjteral\nRPC/encoded\n\nGosu supports WS-I Document Literal for Gosu web service client code. However, it does so by automatically and transparently converting any WSDL for RPC literal mode into WSDL for document literal mode. The focus of the Gosu documentation for WS-I web services is the support for Document Literal encoding. This lesson uses the phrase WS-I to refer exclusively to Document Literal encoding.\n\nGuidewire has deprecated support for RPC-encoded web services.
