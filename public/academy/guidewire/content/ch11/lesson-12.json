Every destination must provide a message transport plugin implementation, but multiple destinations can use the same implementation.\n\nEvents — A list of event names that correspond to the events relevant to this destination. For example, the BankAccountAdded and BankAccountChanged events might be of interest to this external system- Each event triggers the Event Fired rule set for that destination- One user action could trigger multiple events. If one action creates more than one event that the destination listens for, the application runs the Event Fired rules for every combination of event name\nand destination. The strings in the Events list are regex patterns- Developers must be careful to spell the regex patterns in the Events list correctly, as the destination will not work as expected if they are spelled incorrectly. For example, a destination that listens for BankAccountChange will not respond to a BankAccountChanged message event.\n\nBest practice:\nFor example, if the Events list included the string BankAccount, then the destination would listen for BankAccountAdded, BankAccountChanged, and BankAccountRemoved. In practice, though, it is best to explicitly list all the events a destination listens to.",

For example, the BankAccountAdded and BankAccountChanged events might be of interest to this external system- Each event triggers the Event Fired rule set for that destination- One user action could trigger multiple events. If one action creates more than one event that the destination listens for, the application runs the Event Fired rules for every combination of event name\nand destination. The strings in the Events list are regex patterns- Developers must be careful to spell the regex patterns in the Events list correctly, as the destination will not work as expected if they are spelled incorrectly. For example, a destination that listens for BankAccountChange will not respond to a BankAccountChanged message event.\n\nBest practice:\nFor example, if the Events list included the string BankAccount, then the destination would listen for BankAccountAdded, BankAccountChanged, and BankAccountRemoved. In practice, though, it is best to explicitly list all the events a destination listens to.",
