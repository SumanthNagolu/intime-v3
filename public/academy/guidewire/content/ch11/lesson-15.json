Guidewire automatically retries sending of a message when an exception is thrown in the beforeSend or send method. The message destination's Max Retries property determines the maximum number of retries- Because the message has not yet been sent, each attempt should use the sameSenderReflD because it is still the same message — each send attempt does not create a new message. The message request code should set the SenderReflD only if it is null. If a given message exceeds the maximum number of retries, the Guidewire application suspends the destination.The Guidewire application will not send any more messages for a suspended destination. You must resume the destination to remove the suspension.\n\nNote: If a message is sent successfully, but the external system replies with an error, then a NEW message is sent. The new message is a copyof the old message that generated the error at theexternal system- Since this isa NEW message, a new SenderReflD will be generated.\n\nA message could be retried manually.\nThis occurs when a message requires manual intervention- This could be necessary for several reasons, such as a message that caused an exception during send where the situation has now been rectified, or a message whose payload needed to be modified manually, or a message for which the external system never provided a response. An administrator retries the message manually by selecting the message from one of the Message Administration screens and clicking the Retry button- There is no notion of maximum retries for a message retried manually.\nNote: A message could be retried automatically after the sending of the message.",
