      "originalNotes": "What is Guidewire messaging\nThe overall architecture of Guidewire messaging is asynchronous. It is possible for an outbound message to be sent to an external system synchronously or asynchronously, depending on the delivery mechanism supported by the external system. However, typically the messages are not processed immediately upon being placed in the message table. Therefore, since the acknowledging message processing aspect is asynchronous, the overall architecture is considered asynchronous.",
