These processes are crucial for managing the lifecycle of an insurance policy and ensuring compliance with business rules. We'll dive into how cancellations occur, the intricacies of reinstatements, and when a policy rewrite is necessary. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a solid grasp of how these processes interact with the PolicyCenter data model and how you can customize them to fit your organization's needs.",
