To determine if a particular product model entity is available, PolicyCenter first consults the appropriate lookup table to determine the initial set S ofavailable entities. The set S may be a restricted subset of all thepossible entities named in the product model. After PolicyCenter determines the initial set of available entities it applies an availability script, if one exists, to each member of S to filter out more elements. The availability script is a Boolean-value Gosu expression used to limit the available elements. This availability script may be empty, in which case PolicyCenter considers all elements of S available. The availability scriptonly reduces which entities are available from within PolicyCenter.",

For example, a script would be necessary if a coverage pattern is available only for vehicles manufactured after 1986, since this is not a straight equality check. A script may only further restrict table- based availability results; if a pattern is unavailable according to the lookup table,then the script will not even execute.\n\nThe columns in an availability table, such as start effective date, end effective date, and job type, are called dimensions.
