      "narration": "Welcome to our exploration of Notes in Guidewire PolicyCenter. Notes are a fundamental aspect of maintaining detailed records within the system, providing a way for users to document actions and decisions related to policies, accounts, and more. As developers, understanding how Notes interact with other entities in the data model is crucial for customizing and extending PolicyCenter effectively. Let’s dive into how Notes function and how you can leverage them in your implementations.",

Whether it’s a user adding context to a policy decision or a business rule logging an action, Notes help track and provide transparency. They are stored directly in the PolicyCenter database and can be created manually or programmatically using Gosu.",

You might configure Notes to capture specific interactions on a policy, like changes in coverage or updates to customer information. Understanding the practical applications of Notes helps in designing systems that facilitate effective communication and documentation.",

Notes can also be created in business rules. In some cases it may make sense for a given business rule to create and attach a note to a job or account after an automatic action was been taken.\n\nNotes and documents can have distinct functions in PolicyCenter- Notes are written in plain text, created by a user, or through Gosu, and stored only in the PolicyCenter database. Documents are more complex, and might have different Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ( MIME) types such as PDF, Word, or Excel. Documents can be created and stored in either the PolicyCenter database or the document management system (third-party system). Both may use a template.",

      "narration": "In PolicyCenter, it is important to distinguish between Notes and Documents. Notes are plain text entries stored only in the PolicyCenter database, ideal for quick, accessible records. Meanwhile, Documents can include various formats like PDF or Word, potentially stored in a separate document management system. This distinction helps guide when to use each feature, depending on the complexity and type of information you need to manage.",
