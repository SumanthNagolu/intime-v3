A question set gives you a way to determine to whom to market a product, and a way to collect underwriting information that is not pertinent to the rating process.\n\nQuestion sets are linked to the Product in the product model. Questions are not reusable across question sets. If you want the same question asked in two different question sets, you need to create the questions two times. However, question sets can be associated with multiple products. If there are several questions you want to ask for more than one product, you could put those questions in a single question set and then associate that question set with each product.",

Linked to the product model, they help insurers decide who to market which products to, while collecting underwriting information.

This ensures that each product can be tailored precisely to the insurer's requirements.",

Users can use offerings for the following use cases too:\nBusiness-specific products: An insurer offers a business program that consists of a set of common coverages- The insurer offers specialized products based on this business program. These specialized products are offered to retailers, autoshops, and the hospitality industry, among others. These specialized products offer coverage levels appropriate for each business type. Affinity groups: Some insurers write policies that are based on a group membership of the insured. These affinity group policies offer a subset of the available coverages, group-specific default values, and possibly group-specific  value choices for the coverage terms. Often the policy is subject to a special rate agreement, and so must obey various restrictions on the coverages and terms offered.\nPrograms or tiers of coverages: This is similar in concept to the affinity group.
