They have legal language defining who is the insured, the insurer etc. They typically include a set of standard coverages which additional forms will either amend or delete.\nAdditional coverage forms - These forms add additional coverage. For example, a \"Hired Auto Coverage Form“ may add hired auto coverage to a base form where it was not originally specified. Exclusion forms – These forms limit coverages. For example, a \"Mold and Fungus Exclusion Form\" might limit coverage on a homeowners policy such that damage due to mold and fungus is not covered or covered only to a certain amount.\nManuscript forms – These forms are blank forms with space for free form text where the carrier can type one additional legal terms for the policy.",
