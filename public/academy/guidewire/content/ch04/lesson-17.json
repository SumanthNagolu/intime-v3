      "narration": "First, let's clarify the terms coverables and coverages. A coverable is essentially any entity that can be insured, like a house or a person in liability insurance. PolicyCenter uses the policy line as a coverable to represent insureds. For location-based coverages, you should create a specific coverable entity rather than using PolicyLocation directly. As developers, it's crucial to understand that each coverable is represented by its own entity within the data model.",

Configuration users can further sub-divide coverables into Property coverables and Liability coverables. Property coverables are things with physical attributes (height, weight, value, construction type, age, and similar attributes, for example).
