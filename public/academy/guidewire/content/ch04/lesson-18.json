For example, the CP Building coverage table, CPBuildingCov.eti, has three columns for direct coverage terms- When creating a coverage term pattern for a coverage pattern, specify the column where the coverage term values will be stored. For example, when creating a direct coverage term pattern for a CP Building coverage pattem, specify if the value for the coverage term (not the pattern) is stored in the first direct coverage term column or the second direct coverage term column- Standard columns in the data dictionary are also visible in the table.\n\nFor a single coverage, if the number of coverage terms of one type is more than the number of table columns available for that coverage term type, then extend the coverage table and add an additional column. For example, if a given CP building coverage needs four direct coverage terms, but there is no fourth column available so extend the table and add a new column for the fourth direct coverage term.\nFinally,\ndefine Generic coverage term types as custom values which must be a string, date andtime, or Boolean value.
