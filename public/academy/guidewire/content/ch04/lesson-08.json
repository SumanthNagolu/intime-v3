It can also be manually started from the user interface. Both batch jobs and the manual process will start the same renewal Workflow.\n\nThe renewal workflow is an automated process which quotes the renewal, checks conditions or sends documents at various times- When it reaches the effective date of the new term, it completes the renewal job. If the renewal job has a non- renew or not-taken pre- renewal direction, it will end up in a state of non-renew or not-taken. Otherwise, it is automatically bound and Renewed.\n\nThe automated renewal workflow may be manually interrupted by editing the policy transaction. This normally occurs when the underwriter or agent wants to make changes to the renewal job. The renewal job can take a different path, from non- renew to renewed or vice versa. Before the renewal is quoted again, you have the option to non-renew or not- taken even though there is no pre-renewal direction. This completes the renewal job.\n\nAfter you manually quote the renewal job, there are twobind options.
