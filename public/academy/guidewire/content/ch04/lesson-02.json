Every change in the policy is represented by a PolicyPeriod, which is cloned during policy changes, renewals, or other jobs. The cloned branch is updated with the changes and will only be visible when a user views a policy from that branch’s effective date. The cloned branch becomes the base for future changes.\nA revision takes place when a job occurs on a policy- The submission creates the first revision. Each additional transaction on the policy creates a new revision. Therefore, a policy usually has multiple revisions, with one PolicyPeriod entity for each revision. During the contractual period, only one PolicyPeriod entity is in effect at a time.\n\nIn the example, a new revision is created when a policy change is processed that adds a car to the policy. The EffectiveDate for the car is several months into contractual period, and the ExpirationDate extends to the end of the period. PolicyCenter clones a new PolicyPeriod entity and its sub-entities and adds an entity for the new car. The contractual period now has two PolicyPeriods- The new PolicyPeriod entity is in effect-The old PolicyPeriod entity is preserved as a historical record of the policy.\n\nPolicy Term\nA new PolicyTerm is created whenever the policy contract is completely recreated. This occurs with a new policy (submission), a renewal or a rewrite of an existing contract. A new Policy Term is not created when a policy contract is amended with apolicy change job.\n\nThe terms \"policy period\" and •policy term\" are used synonymously throughout the industry. The PolicyPeriod entity represents one historical version of a particular \"policy period’ or •policy term\", but there may be many PolicyPeriods for one •policy period\" or •policy term', all representing how the policy appeared at different points in the model’s timeline . Therefore ”Policy Period” is somewhat different than “policy period”.In order tp avoid confunsion about Which we are talking about at any given time,throughtout this course we will use the term “policy term” to refer to a “policyperiod” or “policyterm” and use “Policy Period” only to refer to the entity that is a specific version of a “policy term”\n\nTransaction effective dates Every transaction has an effective date that identifieswhen it goes into effect, not the date the job was actually run- It may be different from the policy term effective date. For example, a renewal job often takes several weeks (or even months) to run. Therefore, it must be\nexecuted well in advance of the expiration date. The \"renewal\" label indicates when the job became effective. The date the job started would be in advance of the date indicated by the \"renewal\" arrow. The data model uses the term \"Edit Effective Date' for job policy periods so that it is not confused with the policy dates, although they both show up as Effective Date on the user interface.\n\nUsing the previous example, the policy term has the effective date 4/20/08 and an expiration date of 4/20/09, but the renewal job has an edit effective date of 4/20/09 and an expiration date of 4/20/10.

Then, a change job is executed add a motorcycle, and a second change job is executed to add a truck. If themotorcy e JO ms es Irst, then the car policy becomes a car + motorcycle policy. However, the truck job was started on a policy with just a car. When that job finishes, the motorcycle cannot be discarded. Somehow, the results of the motorcycle change job and the truck change job must be Reconciled.\n\nAn \"out of sequence transaction\" (also referred to as an \"out of sequence (OOS) endorsement\" is a policy transaction which is executed after another policy transaction but becomes effective before that policy transaction- The second job changes the state of the policy which could impact how the first job should be executed.\n\nFor example, an auto policy could have one car on it in January - Then, a change job is executed to add a motorcycle to the policy in June. After that, another change job is executed to add a truck to the policy back in March. The second job must be treated in two pieces: March to June (in which only a truck is being added) and June forward (in which a motorcycle and a truck are added).\n\nPreemptions and OOS transactions are discussed later in this course in the Out- Of-Sequence Transactions lesson under Policy Transactions.",
