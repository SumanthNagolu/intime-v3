Users can modify the underwriting infrastructure such as they can define underwriting issues or determine the types of underwriting issues that a user can approve. The underwriting rules specify things such as the state or jurisdiction of coverage and minimum or maximum amounts. For example, when an agent creates a new policy,  certain terms of that policy may need to be reviewed by underwriting before the policy can be bound. The underwriting rules of the carrier require that an underwriter approve any vehicle valued at over SIOO,OOO. If an agent adds a car valued at $200,000 in a personal auto policy, an underwriter must give approval for that car. PolicyCenter creates an issue for the undewriter which prevents the agent from binding the policy until the underwriter approves the issue.",

      "originalNotes": "How are UW issues raised?\nIn general, Guidewire recommends that you raise underwriting issues as early as possible. Carefully consider the point at which the underwriting issue blocks progress. For example, you can raise fire hazard issues before quoting a policy, but have the issue block binding. By raising underwriting issues early, the user is aware of the issues early and can plan how to deal with them.  Consider example of a submission job, where the user adds a high value vehicle with a VIN number The high value vehicle causes PolicyCenter to raise underwriting issues before quoting.\n\nIn the base configuration, the IPolicyEvaluationPlugin c hecks whether there are issues to create before quote for this policy period and its lines of business. For example, the High value vehicle issue raises an issue if vehicle cost is greater than $100,000. In this case, the code creates an issue based on the VIN number and another issue for high-value vehicle.  The IPolicyEvaluationPlugin p lugin has input parameters for the current checking set (Quote Issues) and policy period. The plugin calls evaluator classes that evaluate and raise underwriting issues. The plugin calls line-of-business- specific evaluators (PA UnderwriterEvaluator.gs  for example) for each line of business in the policy period. The plugin then calls the default evaluator (DefaultUnderwriterEvaluator- gs).\n\nThe evaluators retrieve issue type definitions (UWIssueType) which is defined through the underwriting rule user interface- You can set the rule condition to raise underwriting issue in the UW rule user interface. It is easier for the authorized users to check and update the rules.  You can also modify the LOB specific evaluators to raise underwriting issues for more complex conditions- It is recommended to write the condition to raise underwriting issues in either the IJI or the evaluator class.  Using both will result in unpredictability. \n\n When determining whether to raise an issue, the evaluators checks the business rules and triggers the issue if any rules are subscribed at each checking set (see evaluator method AbstractlJnderwriterEvalutor. gs) and then triggers the issue if there are any hard coded rules in the LOB specific evaluator- \n\nThe IPolicyEvaluationPlugin c hecks for orphaned issues and removes them. In this case, e plugn In finds  orphaned issues. Orphaned issues are underwriting issues that were generated by this checking set but are no longer an issue at this time-\n\nBefore quoting, the Gosu code checks for issues that block quote and any earlier blocking points- In this example, there are issues that block quote.  PolicyCenter displays a screen listing the VIN issue that blocks quote and does not quote the policy.  PolicyCenter does not highlight the issue for the high value vehicle because job progress is already blocked at an earlier point.",
