The cloned branch is updated with the changes (such as delete a driver oradd a new car etc.)- The changes made to this cloned branch will be visible only when a user views policy from that branch's effective date. This cloned branch becomes the base to becloned for future changes and so forth. (In contrast, a submission job's branch is not cloned from another branch.)  Policy term and policy periods: \nPolicy Term A new Policy Term is created whenever the policy contractis completely recreated. This occurs with a new policy (submission), a renewal, or a rewrite of an existing contract. A new Policy Term is not created when you amend a policy contract with a policy change job- \nPolicy Period\nThe Policy Period entity stores information for a specific revision of the contract ualperiod of a policy. A revision occurs anytime a job occurs on a policy. A submission creates the first revision Each additional transaction on the policy (such as a policy change) creates a new revision. Therefore, a policy almost always has multiple revisions, with one Policy Period entity for each revision. During the contractual period, only one Policy Period entity is in effect\nat a time. A new revision is created when you process a policy change that adds a car to the policy- The Effective Date for the car is several months into contractual period, and the Expiration Date extends to the end of the period. Policy enter clones a new Policy Period entity and its sub entities and adds an entity for the new car. The contractual period now has two  Policy eriods- The new Policy Period entity is in effect-The old Policy Period entity is preserved as a historical record of the policy.",

For example, in a submission job shared and revisioned contact information may be edited such as last name or first name. The change gets made on both the account and policy. \n\nPC considers the last time a contact was updated (telling us how •current' account contact information is) when compared to a job's effective date to determine how to treat revisioned data. Contact information and any potential changes made to revisioned contact data during the course of a job can be considered current, future dated or back dated. \n\nA contact's last update time is updated each time the account level contact information gets modified:\n\nIf it is modified in the context of a policy job, it is set to the effective date of that job\nIf it is modified at the account or cross-account level, it is set to the current date-\n\nFor example, when a contact is created in the context of a submission, then the last update time is set to the effective date of the job (though it can never be in the future). And it can't ever be moved backwards — it should always represent the latest date the contact was updated-\n\nIn the example, when Jane Smith get two policies (one PA and one BOP) policy on the same date, the contact information is copied over or shared from the account to both policies. Data does not need to be synced during a cancellation or an audit job.",

If the field is revisioned, it can be changed on the\naccount level even after the policy is bound. The information is updated on the\naccount and can be obtained by policies for future jobs.\n\nSS Se ee eee eo",
