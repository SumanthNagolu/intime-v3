      "originalNotes": "Review: Underwriting approval process\nIJnderwriting Approval Process: UW issues are created during any job such as a submission or a policy change. Since job has a one-to-one relationship with Policy Period the underwriting issues are on a Policy Period. In the underwriting approval process, the policy period can be referred to users with higher or\ndifferent authority profiles. The assignment can be customized in the field to use Assignment Rules, as needed to match customer practices. These users receive activities  notifying them they need to approve issues on the policy A particular policy may be referred to several users before being approved. When the underwriter or whoever is reviewing the policy, feels that the review of the policy is complete, whether issues have been approved or not, they click the Release Lock button. This releases the policy from underwriting, and Policy Center sends an activity to the user who initiated the referral-\n\nThe Initial Referrer role stores the name of this user. (The underwriter can modify the recipient and other fields in the activity.) To facilitate passing policies between agents and underwriters, a given policy period can be flagged as edit locked and quote hidden- After an agent hands these policies to an underwriter, the agent usually cannot edit the policy or view an unreleased quote- The permissions for editing or viewing the quote while under review are usually reserved for underwriters-\n\nInitial Referrer: The Initial Referrer user role facilitates passing policies between underwriting and producers. The initial referrer is the user who referred the policy to underwriting. When requesting approval for issues on a policy period if the Initial Referrer user role is not set, the role is set to the current user- When the underwriter releases the policy by clicking the Release button, the Initial Referrer role is unset An activity is sent to the Initial Referrer on the period. You can also customize the Initial Referrer user role-\n\nThe Initial Referrer user role is a transient role assigned to users in the context of their role in the job- Because it is a transient role, it is assigned by the job code rather than being assigned to the user in the Administration tab. Because it is a transient role, it is not in the User Role type list",
