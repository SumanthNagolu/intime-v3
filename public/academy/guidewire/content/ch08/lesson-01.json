Both the original and the new policy period are considered to be part of the same policy\n\n Also, if a policy is changed, cancelled, reinstated, or has a rewrite, then each of these transactions also creates a new policy period. (For example, if a policy is a 6-month personal auto policy, and 4 months into the policy a new car is added to the policy, then the policy will consist of two policy periods: one lasting four months with the original vehicles(s), and a second lasting two months with the original vehicle(s) and the newly added car).",
