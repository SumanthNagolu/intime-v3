The PolicyCenter default application contains a set of roles that perform the policy tasks in most organizations. In order to perform these tasks, a user must be assigned a role with the appropriate permissions- Typically, in the base configuration, the Superuser role is granted all permissions and is responsible for granting permissions to other roles. Once the roles are configured, then each PolicyCenter user is assigned a specific role that relates to the tasks to be performed\n\nNote: Although in the base configuration, Superuser has all permissions, but that could change if a customer adds custom permissions. Also, Superuser is configured in the base product as the role that would grant permissions to other roles, but a customer could configure any role to do that.",
