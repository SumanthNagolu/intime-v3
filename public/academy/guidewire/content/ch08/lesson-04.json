      "originalNotes": "Contact role behavior patterns in PolicyCenter\nThere are a number of contact role behavior patterns that we see consistently in PolicyCenter- When configuring new contact roles, you should take into consideration what behavior pattern you want that contact role to have and then you can use one of the existing contact roles with that behavior as an example for configuration of your new contact role.\n Normal: This pattern can be used when you have an array of contacts that fill this role (and those contacts potentially have some fields specific to that role but those fields are a simple set of fields.) Note, the pattern does not specify where this array is attached. The example given, additional named insureds, attach at the Policy Period level — but you could have an array\nof entities with simple properties that attached at the vehicle level or the location level.\nSingleton: Use this pattern when there is only ever one of this particular contact role at any given time. Note, this is again at whatever level it attaches to- The Billing Contact attaches at the Policy Period level so there is only ever one on the policy at any given time because it is a singleton. However, you could have another contact role — say Location Billing Contact — that is also a singleton, but attaches at the Location level- In that case, there could be one-and-only-one Location Billing Contact attached to each Location — but that could result in multiple Location Billing Contacts on the policy as a whole.\nSimple Details: This pattern refers to contact roles where the contact can fill the role in multiple different ways, so you need an array of details. Like the other patterns, this doesn't say where the contact role attaches. In the base configuration, both Additional lnsured and Additional lnterest are of the simple details pattern.\nJoin Details refers to contact roles where there is a many-to-many relationship between the role and another entity on the policy- Driver is the classic example of this there may be two drivers on a policy There is a policy driver record for each of those drivers- But there are three vehicles on the policy, and those two drivers can be drivers on each of those three vehicles, so a join table is used to represent that relationship — but each of the drivers is only represented by a single Policy Driver record.",
