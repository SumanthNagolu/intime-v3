      "originalNotes": "Primary versus role-based assignment\nGuidewire refers to certain business entities as assignable entities. There are tvo types of assignable entities: Primary vs Role Based. To be primarily assignable, an entity must implement Assignable and PCAssignable delegates, which provide methods and fields needed for assignment. The Activity entity implements the Assignable and PCAssignable delegates.\n\nA Delegate data object is a reusable entity that contains an interface and a default implementation of that interface. This permits an entity to implement an interface while delegating the implementation of that interface to another class, that of the delegate. You often use a delegate with objects that share code. The delegate implements the code rather than each class duplicating the shared code. Thus, a delegate is an entity associated with an implemented interface that multiple parent entities can reuse.",

Furthermore, there is some risk that a rule further down in the list will reassign your entity to another group in a way that you do not want. Therefore, it is important to execute the actions-exit() method as soon as the object has an appropriate group assignment- By wrapping the assignment method inside an  IF command, you will exit the rule set if and only if the assignment is successful. It is best practice to use this approach for every assignment method in your assignment rule sets- \n\nIn the example, Policy Center executes the assign() method for a given activity.
