Similar prefixes and hierarchical numbering are used in all the rule sets in the ClaimCenter base configuration The best practice is to use this scheme (3-4 characters for rule set and 5 for a hierarchy-reflecting number), because the use of these codes in logging can be very helpful. You may choose not to use this schema, but we recommend you adopt a logical schema for naming Gosu rules which allows easily traceable logging.",
