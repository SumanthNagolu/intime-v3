For example, the New Claim Wizard could have a Vehicles step which should be displayed for personal auto and commercial auto claims. In this case, the step's visibility would be tied to the loss type being \"Auto\". (Theoretically, you could tie it to the policy type being \"personal auto\" or \"commercial auto\", but this approach can have long-term problems if a line of business has more than two policy types - which would mean increasingly complex conditions in the logic - or if new policy types are added in the future - which would require changes to the IJI logic that would not have been needed if the condition had been tied to the loss level.)",

It is a set of information needed during claims processing that relates to one or more similar types of coverages. For example, the coverages \"Collision\" and 'Liability — Bodily Injury and Property Damage\" both cover damage to a vehicle- (\"Collision\" covers damage to the insured's vehicle from collision with another object.

Although it may be tempting to create additional 'custom’ exposure types, the General’ exposure type should handle any edge cases- Coverage Subtypes allow us to link many coverage types to a small set of exposure types.\n\nCases occur when the same pair of coverage typefexposure type map together in different ways (explained with the next slide). When this occurs, a normal M:M relationship will not cover the complexities of the situation. Inserting CoverageSubtype between them resolves this problem- In the first example above, the Collision coverage (from an auto policy) maps to the Vehicle Damage exposure type- Whenever a loss is covered by the collision coverage, the adjuster must gather information about the damage done to the vehicle. No other information will ever be relevant to that coverage- In the second example above, the 'Liability — Bodily Injury and Property damage“ coverage (for an auto policy) maps to the Bodily Injury (damage), Vehicle (damage), and Property (damage) exposure types. Whenever a loss is covered by this coverage, the adjuster mustga er In orma on a out either an injury, a damaged vehicle, or a damaged piece of property. The relevant exposure type depends on what was damaged. In the third example above, General Liability coverage for a Commercial Package policy maps only to the General (damage) exposure. However, the policy outlines two limits for the coverage: a$100,000 limit on Premises/Operations, and a $50,000 limit on Products/Completed Operations- In both cases, the adjuster must gather similar information about the damage, but the financial exposure is different based on the circumstance of the loss.",

Although it may be tempting to create additional 'custom’ exposure types, the General’ exposure type should handle any edge cases- Coverage Subtypes allow us to link many coverage types to a small set of exposure types.\n\nCases occur when the same pair of coverage typefexposure type map together in different ways (explained with the next slide). When this occurs, a normal M:M relationship will not cover the complexities of the situation. Inserting CoverageSubtype between them resolves this problem- In the first example above, the Collision coverage (from an auto policy) maps to the Vehicle Damage exposure type- Whenever a loss is covered by the collision coverage, the adjuster must gather information about the damage done to the vehicle. No other information will ever be relevant to that coverage- In the second example above, the 'Liability — Bodily Injury and Property damage“ coverage (for an auto policy) maps to the Bodily Injury (damage), Vehicle (damage), and Property (damage) exposure types. Whenever a loss is covered by this coverage, the adjuster mustga er In orma on a out either an injury, a damaged vehicle, or a damaged piece of property. The relevant exposure type depends on what was damaged. In the third example above, General Liability coverage for a Commercial Package policy maps only to the General (damage) exposure. However, the policy outlines two limits for the coverage: a$100,000 limit on Premises/Operations, and a $50,000 limit on Products/Completed Operations- In both cases, the adjuster must gather similar information about the damage, but the financial exposure is different based on the circumstance of the loss.",

This is particularly useful in the case where an archived claim is returned to the main database after a change in the LOB model — the old relationships will still be in place.
