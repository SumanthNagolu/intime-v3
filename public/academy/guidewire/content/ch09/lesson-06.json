This ensures, for example, that a US ZIP (postal) code has exactly 5 or exactly 9 digits; anything else is malformed and must be rejected (not saved). Similarly, the date and time of loss for a claim must not be prior to today's date.\n\nThe second type of validation is validation by rules. This is related to the object maturity model, which we will cover in a few slides. The point here is that rules can prevent a claim from moving Zbackwards\" by removal of or changes to data already present, and can prevent a new claim from being saved at all if it doesn't meet certain standards.",
