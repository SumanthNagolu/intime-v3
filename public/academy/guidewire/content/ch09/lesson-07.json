In the example above, if the rule CONDITION returns true, the Segment value of \"auto_high\" is set and the rule set is exited. If the rule CONDITION returns false, the next rule in the Exposure Segmentation rule set executes (ESGOI 400 – Auto Default). This rule applies to any exposure with a Segment value of \"null\".
