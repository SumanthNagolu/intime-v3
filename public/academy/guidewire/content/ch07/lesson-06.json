      "originalNotes": "Review: Detail View\nDetail view panels are generally designed to use widgets to organize and manage a collection of related pieces of information that constitute a single record. The most obvious example is the set of individual fields of an instance of an entity such as User, Claim, or Policy. There are no constraints imposed by the system as to what information can be displayed by a detail view, however; the view could present information from multiple entities that do not even have to be related to one another, in addition to information that does not derive from an entity at all (such as calculated or static values).\n\nThe purpose of a detail view panel, however, and the recommended practice behind their use, is to present the user with all of the detailed information that is relevant to that interface, and no information that is irrelevant. In general, this means displaying information about the fields of a particular entity and possibly fields from a small number of closely related entities.\n\nDetail view panels must contain at least one column and can contain as many columns as necessary to present the widgets in the most effective way for the user.",
