Create a new subtype only if you need to treat one set of entities differently from another.

For example, there are subtypes for AutoRepairShop and AutoTowi ngAgcy. If you work with an auto repair shop that also does towing, you cannot create a single contact that does both. However, you can add a service for Towing to an auto repair shop contact\n\nYou cannot create a subtype that inherits the fields of both entities. To create the subtype you want, you can select one entity or the other and subtype and then add the fields that are missing from the other entity because of single inheritance.\n\nAdditionally, each time you create a new subtype, you must modify PCF files to support both creating the subtype and searching for it You might also need to make supporting modifications to the screens that reference subtype in terms of modal PCF support.",
