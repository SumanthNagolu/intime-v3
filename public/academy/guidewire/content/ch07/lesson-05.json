For every field in the data model entity, there is a field in the corresponding generated Java class. For example, the ABContact data model entity has a \"Name\" field, and the generated ABContact Java class also has a \"Name\" field.\n\nWhenever the application needs to work with an instance of a data model entity (which is stored as a row in the corresponding database table), the application creates an instance of the corresponding Java class. The information from the database is then read into that instance.

When an object is created, all of the information about the object is copied into memory. If the object is subtyped, then data for all the fields at every relevant subtype level is retrieved. For example, if an object is an AB Doctor, then information is copied over for fields at the AB Contact, AB Person, AB Person Vendor, and AB Doctor levels. Fields associated with AB Place, AB Company, or AB Attorney are irrelevant and ignored.\n\nWhen an object is referenced, the server uses the datatype of the reference to understand the structure of the information in memory. For example, assume that there is an object named \"an AB Contact\" that stores information about an AB Doctor- If there is reference to this object with a datatype of \"ABDoctor\", thethe server knows that the object will have AB Contact fields, AB Person fields, AB Person Vendor fields, and AB Doctor fields. If there is a reference to this object with a datatype of \"AB Person\", then the server knows that the object will have AB Contact fields, AB Person fields, ABPersonVendor fields, and ABDoctor fields. If there is a reference to this object with a datatype of \"ABPerson\", then the server knows that the object will have ABContact fields and ABPerson fields, but it will assume that the object has no fields beyond the ABPerson fields- There may be additional fields with information at the ABPersonVendor and ABDoctor levels, but the server will be unaware of them.\n\nIn some cases, a method or user interface container receives a reference to an object, and the reference uses a \"high-level\" datatype (such as ABContact). This reference cannot be used as- is to access fields below the specified level because the server assumes those fields don't exist. There is a programming technique known as casting in which you explicitly state the datatype for a subtyped object. This is done using the syntax \"as <datatype>\", where <datatype> is the datatype that you want to explicitly identify- When youcast a reference, you areproviding the server with more information about the structure of the object- A casted reference can access fields that an uncasted reference cannot.",

If there is a reference to this object with a datatype of \"ABPerson\", then the server knows that the object will have ABContact fields and ABPerson fields, but it will assume that the object has no fields beyond the ABPerson fields- There may be additional fields with information at the ABPersonVendor and ABDoctor levels, but the server will be unaware of them.\n\nIn some cases, a method or user interface container receives a reference to an object, and the reference uses a \"high-level\" datatype (such as ABContact). This reference cannot be used as- is to access fields below the specified level because the server assumes those fields don't exist. There is a programming technique known as casting in which you explicitly state the datatype for a subtyped object. This is done using the syntax \"as <datatype>\", where <datatype> is the datatype that you want to explicitly identify- When youcast a reference, you areproviding the server with more information about the structure of the object- A casted reference can access fields that an uncasted reference cannot.",
