The widget always has the same ID, regardless of the state of the application or the\nvalues of any business data. The property does not evaluate an expression, just the value of a type, such as a String or Integer value.\n\nThe editable property evaluates a boolean expression and the expression can be a dynamic value, in this case, one that returns true or false. The labe \nproperty evaluates a string expression. This lesson discusses display keys later on. Display keys are a type of string expression in Guidewire applications for localizing text. The value property is also a dynamic property. The value property evaluates an object expression that binds the object property to it.\n\nBoth types of widget properties can be required properties for a specific type of widget.",
