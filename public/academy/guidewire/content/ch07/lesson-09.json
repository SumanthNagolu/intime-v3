You organize the rules in a rule set into a hierarchy that fits your business model- In other words, a rule set combines many individual rules into a useful set to consider as a group. One way that Guidewire helps you define the organization of rules is with a root entity and common triggers- A rule set is a collection of rules that share the same root entity and share common triggers- You write code for new rule set categories to define the triggers associated with a rule set. If you create rulesets for an existing rule set category (Event Messaging, Pre-update, and Validation), you do not need write trigger code.\n\nExecution of rules always occurs at the rule set level. Unless the rules engine encounters an exit() command, all rules in the rule set are executed.\n\nTrainingApp is built by heavily customizing an instance of Contact Manager, and therefore has the same rule sets as Contact Manager. These include:\n\nThe Event Fired rule set, which is associated with Message Context and triggers when a Message Context object fires an integration event.\n\nThe AB Contact Validation rule set, which is associated with AB Contact and triggers when an AB Contact object is created or modified. ABContact Validation rules are designed to identify invalid changes to AB Contacts. AB Contact Pre-update rules are designed to take actions required because of changes to an AB Contact.\n\nThe Region Validation rule set, which is associated with Region and triggers when a Region object is created or modified.",

For example, validation rule sets are\nexecute all. All validation conditions are checked, regardless of how many are true. In\nan \"exit after first action\" rule set, you do not typically execute all rules. When the first\ntrue condition is found, the action associated with that condition is taken and the rule\nset is exited. For example, assignment rule sets are exit after first action. Once an\nassignment is made, the rule set exits so that later code doesn't reassign the object.\nSOOO ODDDSDoOODDODOoOoS",
