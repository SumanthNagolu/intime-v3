When it is either not convenient to edit the object in a location or some of the fields a user might wish to view and/or edit are not displayed in that location, you can use a popup. For example, a list view panel will often only display a limited number of object fields. Some of the cell widgets will be configured as navigation cell widgets. The navigation cells widgets will navigate to a popup so that a user can view and/or edit the object fields.\n\nIn the slide example, the FlagEntryPopup popup is used to view existing flag entry objects and, if the user has sufficient permissions, edit them. However, it cannot be used to create flag entry objects. Flag entries are created only by the application business logic, not manually by a user.\n\nWhen a popup edits an existing object, the popup does not return the object to the parent list view. The parent list view panel already knows about the object, and the object already belongs to the array that is being displayed by the list view. Therefore, the popup simply commits and changes to the object in the database. The parent list view panel then refreshes its information from the database.",
