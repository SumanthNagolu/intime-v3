The names of the fields in the custom entity do not need to end with the Ext sufix.\n\nThe name of the database table is automatically generated to match the name of the ETI file and is all lowercase, for example, bankaccount ext. Guidewire creates a special prefix for custom entities by appending x to the two-letter product code for the table name, such as abx bankaccount ext. The table name is an attribuTe of the entity xml element and must have a length of 25 characters or less. When creating an entity, if the entity name has a length of more than 25 characters, you can modify the table name in the Entity dialog to reduce the length to 25 or less, including removing the ext sufix from the table name.",
