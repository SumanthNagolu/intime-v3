Users navigate from one page in a Location Group to the next by clicking the links in the side bar.\nAll the pages in a Location Group share a common info bar, actions menu, and side bar.\nThe tab bar appears at the top of the screen and allows the user to navigate to different parts of the application. For example, to view another claim from the Claim dropdown menu, to go to an appropriate search screen or the address book,and so on.\nThe info bar is the area directly below the tab bar that usually contains icons providing high-level information about the data in the screen area. In the example above, the info bar contains a \"car\" icon indicating this is a personal auto claim. It shows the name of the insured \"Ins: Ray Newton\", and the date of loss 001: 01/02/2021\". Note that some Location Groups do not have info bars, in which case this area is blank.\nThe actions menu is themenu accessible by clicking the \"Actions\" control. The side bar appears on the left of the screen and contains a set of links to the pages in the Location Group. Pages and Location Groups are both Locations.\nThis gives widgets the ability to navigate to the Location Group (in which case thescreen for the first page listed in the Location Group is displayed) or to any page within the Location Group- For example, you might have one widget that needs to navigate to the ABContactLG Location Group, and a second widget that should specifically navigate to the Addresses page in the ABContactLG Location\nGroup.",
