You can update it, clone it to create a copy, or define a new plan.\n\nWhat invoice items should be paid?\nInvoice items are filtered according to the filters listed in this section of the payment allocation plan- The filters are logically ANDed- In the example, only positive, billed or due items are eligible to be paid automatically. Two additional filters (Policy Period and Invoice) apply only to payments that are associated with a particular policy period or invoice. Suppose you used the Multiple Payment Entry wizard to enter a payment of $50 for invoice 100000130 belonging to account #TR000050. The Invoice filter restricts the eligible invoice items to those items on invoice 100000130.\n\nThe Positive filter means that only positive invoice items are eligible to be paid. A negative invoice item represents an amount the insurance company owes to the insured. \"Paying\" a negative invoice item means releasing the credit for the amount of the negative invoice item and applying it elsewhere. BillingCenter provides a separate credit allocation plan for handling neqative invoice items and the resulting credit. See the Credit Handling chapter in the BillingCenter Application Guide for details.\n\nWhat order do you want to pay them in? The next step establishes the order in which to pay the eligible items. This step groups the eligible items from step 1 according to the priorities in the plan. Invoice items in each group are paid pro rata based on their unpaid amounts. In the example, invoice items from recapture charges will be paid first. Assuming there is remaining money to allocate and remaining eligible invoice items, these will be paid pro rata according to their placement dates. The third entry (Charge Pattern) will be ignored because all eligible invoice items will have been paid-",
