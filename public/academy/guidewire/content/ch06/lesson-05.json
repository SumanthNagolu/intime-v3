      "originalNotes": "Invoice stream periodicities\nThe screenshot shows the list of payment intervals that are available without configuration in BillingCenter. Each payment interval can be implemented by one of the four invoice stream periodicities shown on the slide.\nAccounts using account-level billing have up to four invoice streams — a monthly stream, a weekly stream, a twice-a-month stream,  and an every-other-week stream. This provides appropriate streams for all of the account's charges, regardless of the payment intervals of their payment plans.\nAccounts using policy- level billing have a separate invoice stream for each policy.\n\nBillingCenter creates invoice streams lazily—that is, each stream is created only when there is a charge to be invoiced in that stream- Every invoice must be within a stream—an invoice cannot be associated directly with an account.\n\nEach invoice stream has a base interval (weekly, every other week, monthly, and twice monthly)- Any interval that is a multiple of monthly uses the monthly stream- The monthly stream is also used for all account-level charges.  \n\nEvery Other Week and Twice per Month require different invoice streams because there is a requirement to synchronize the dates with an insurer's payroll. Twice Per Month requires two dates  (such as 15 and 31) for establishing invoice dates whereas Every Other Week has simply a day of week such as Friday. \n\nYou can create custom invoice streams in the IJI or through configuration- Through configuration, you can create custom periodicities and invoice streams that support your custom periodicities.  \n\nNote: 31 is used to indicate the last day of the month.  This date is automatically adjusted for the number of days in the month- For February, 31 can mean 28 Feb or 29 Feb depending on the year.",
      "notes": "Invoice stream periodicities\nThe screenshot shows the list of payment intervals that are available without configuration in BillingCenter. Each payment interval can be implemented by one of the four invoice stream periodicities shown on the slide.\nAccounts using account-level billing have up to four invoice streams — a monthly stream, a weekly stream, a twice-a-month stream,  and an every-other-week stream. This provides appropriate streams for all of the account's charges, regardless of the payment intervals of their payment plans.\nAccounts using policy- level billing have a separate invoice stream for each policy.\n\nBillingCenter creates invoice streams lazily—that is, each stream is created only when there is a charge to be invoiced in that stream- Every invoice must be within a stream—an invoice cannot be associated directly with an account.\n\nEach invoice stream has a base interval (weekly, every other week, monthly, and twice monthly)- Any interval that is a multiple of monthly uses the monthly stream- The monthly stream is also used for all account-level charges.  \n\nEvery Other Week and Twice per Month require different invoice streams because there is a requirement to synchronize the dates with an insurer's payroll. Twice Per Month requires two dates  (such as 15 and 31) for establishing invoice dates whereas Every Other Week has simply a day of week such as Friday. \n\nYou can create custom invoice streams in the IJI or through configuration- Through configuration, you can create custom periodicities and invoice streams that support your custom periodicities.  \n\nNote: 31 is used to indicate the last day of the month.  This date is automatically adjusted for the number of days in the month- For February, 31 can mean 28 Feb or 29 Feb depending on the year.",
