        "answer": "An account gives PolicyCenter users the flexibility to create and manage a customer's account independent of policies with which the account may be associated. The ability to manage an account separately from a policy can be useful when assigning policy and account visibility to different types of users.\n\nIn addition, PolicyCenter utilizes the name clearance function to ensure that a person or company is not an existing account and that they are not represented by another producer for the given policy type.",
