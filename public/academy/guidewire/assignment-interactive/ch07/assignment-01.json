      "referenceAnswer": "Common submission states include Draft, Quoted, Application, Bound, Issued, Declined, Not Taken, and Withdrawn. The system tracks these states to manage the lifecycle of a policy from initial creation through approval. Each state represents a business milestone and may trigger different rules, validations, and available actions. This state machine approach ensures proper workflow enforcement.",

The Account represents the customer (person or company) while Policies represent the specific insurance products they've purchased. This hierarchy allows: (1) a single customer view across all their policies, (2) shared contact and billing information, (3) cross-policy reporting and analytics, and (4) consistent workflow management. It mirrors real-world insurance relationships where one customer can hold multiple policies.",

      "referenceAnswer": "Configurable areas include: (1) User Roles and Permissions - insurers need to control who can access what based on their organizational structure; (2) Workflow rules and activity patterns - different insurers have different business processes and approval chains; (3) Business settings like default values and validation rules - each insurer has unique business rules for underwriting, pricing, and policy management. These are configurable because they represent business decisions that vary by insurer, not technical requirements.",

      "question": "What is the difference between the Desktop tab and the Account tab in PolicyCenter?",
      "explanation": "The Desktop tab is a personalized workspace showing your activities, submissions, and renewals - it's your daily workflow hub. The Account tab is entity-focused, allowing you to search for, view, and manage specific customer accounts and their associated data. Desktop is user-centric; Account is data-centric."
    },
    {
      "type": "reference",
      "id": "ref-02",
      "variant": "review",
      "question": "Why does PolicyCenter use a state machine for submission workflows?",
      "explanation": "State machines enforce valid business transitions (e.g., you can't jump from Draft directly to Issued without going through Quote and Bind). This ensures business rules are respected, provides clear audit trails, enables role-based permissions at each stage, and allows automated actions (like notifications) to trigger on specific state changes."
