  "full_text": "Succeed Insurance issues payments through Franklin Square National Bank. Succeed's agreement with the bank specifies that once a check has been issued a check number, it cannot be voided. At this point Succeed Insurance would have to issue a stop payment on the check. To implement this, I have created a validation rule. This is the rule, Prevent Voiding of Issued Checks. The rule only applies to check sets, so I set the condition to make this distinction. The rule must examine each check individually, because if there are any checks in the check set that meet the criteria, then the whole check set will be rejected. There are three criteria a check must meet to cause the rejection of the check set. The first is that the status property of the check has changed. The second criterion is that the new status must be Pending Void. Recall the ClaimCenter does not void checks, that is done by a request to the external check processing system, which then reports back to ClaimCenter that the check has been voided. And the third criterion is that the check must have a check number. These three criteria, taken together, mean that the user is attempting to void a check that has had a check number assigned to it. If the transaction set is to be rejected, then I want ClaimCenter to highlight the fact that the check has a check number. The check number is a property of the check associated with the transaction set, so a check number is a subfield. So I use the Reject Subfield method. The check set will be voided based on the check and its check number field. The transaction set will be voided regardless of the claims validation level, though if there is a check it should be at ready to pay, so I set the validation level to new loss. Then the error message will include the check number. And it will suggest issuing a stop payment on the check instead. Since there's no point in having both an error and a warning, the last two parameters of the Reject Subfield method are both null. To test the rule I log in. I navigate to a claim with a check already on it. The check already has a check number. I click it to navigate to the check. I attempt to void the check. I attempt to void the check. ClaimCenter asks whether I really want to void the check. This is standard behavior in the base configuration. When I click OK, I get the expected error message, telling me that I cannot void the check and must instead stop it. I'll clear the error. Now I'll try to stop the check. When I click OK on the standard message, I see that the check is in pending stop status. This concludes the transaction set validation rules demonstration.
