  "full_text": "In this demo, I'll review claim intake from a user's perspective, and at the same time take a look at it from behind the scenes in Studio's PCF files. I'm logged on as Darlene Olson, an adjuster. I receive a call from Jennifer Albee at Lennar Construction, reporting that a worker has been injured, so I start a new claim. Notice, by the way, that the title says that this is step 1. I search for the Lennar Construction policy. There is only one policy matching this search, so it is automatically selected. Because it is a worker's compensation policy, the header changes, indicating that this is step 1 of 4. I'll type CTRL-SHIFT-I to view the details of the PCF behind this step. The screen I am viewing is part of the new claim wizard, also called the FNAL wizard. The screen is the FNAL wizard underscore find policy screen. Note that the naming can be used as part of the new claim wizard, also called the FNAL wizard. The convention for the screens in a wizard is wizard name underscore screen name. Let's look at this in Studio. Looking at this screen, I notice some fields called shared section modes, which I'll explain in the next demo. But what I want to show you right now, is that, if I select search in this field, I now see the fields I saw in the UI. Speaking of the UI, Ms. Albee tells me that the injury occurred at the beginning of today's morning shift, at 8am. Moving on to the next page of the new claim wizard. The injury occurred at the company's headquarters. Ms. Albee is the supervisor of the injured employee, 1 Edward Teach. I add Mr. Teach. I add Mr. Teach as the injured employee. Ms. Albee has also provided me with a total of statements, Mr.Teach's social security number. I'll type Alt Shift I again. I'm still viewing the FNUL wizard, and now the screen is the basic info screen. At this point, I want to show you the structure of the wizard itself. I open FNULwizard.pcf. Structurally, a wizard is simply a list of steps. A wizard has some interesting properties. The first is menu actions. You may recall from location groups that this defines the actions menu that will appear. It also has the standard claim info bar and tab bar. The cancel warning property specifies the text of a pop-up message that appears if you cancel the claim before finishing the wizard. This message should be stored as a display key. The wizard goes through the steps in order. You can create step sets that group steps, so that you can make them available or unavailable together. The full wizard step set is the main body of the FNUL wizard. Note that its visibility property is true only if the old wizard step property is false, which is the default. This exists for backwards compatibility. Within the step set, the individual steps have their own visible and available conditions. The only step for which these do not simply default to true is the services step, which does not make sense for some policy types. The services step determines its availability by a property coded in the wizard. The code for a servicer's step available checks against a list of lost types for which a services step makes sense. In the base configuration, these include auto and property. Each step in the wizard has a screen property. This identifies the signature of a screen which will be displayed when the wizard reaches that step. Each step also has a title property, which references a display key. Note that this display key takes variables that reference the current step number and the total number of steps for the wizard. Finally, let's look at two special types of step. The first is the quick claim step. A quick claim step bypasses the normal set of steps and inputs the essential information on one screen. The quick claim step has a property called condition, which determines whether it is available. For example, the quick claim auto step is available only if the loss type is auto. The decision to use the quick claim step is made by the user in the first step of the wizard. Some steps are independent of the wizard's built-in sequencing. They are available from anywhere in the wizard, except for the first step, where the policy is found. Independent steps have their independent property set to true. Independent steps are usually grouped in a special step set called an independent wizard step set, which appears at the end of the wizard steps. Grouping in this manner is a recommended standard, but not required. Any step marked as independent will be an independent step. The independent steps for the FNAL wizard include parties involved, policy, documents, and notes. This concludes our tour of wizard structure, so I'll cancel the claim now. This ends the wizard structure demonstration.                  DEMONSTRATION  DEMONSTRATION           DEMONSTRATION Thank you.",
