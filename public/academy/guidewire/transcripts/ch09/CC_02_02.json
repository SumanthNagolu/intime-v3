  "full_text": "Succeed Insurance wants to capture additional information for electronics damage and theft. To this end, they have chosen to create a new exposure type, electronics, on the LOB model. As a result of this, electronics damage will no longer be associated with the vehicle damage exposure type. At first, this exposure type will be used for the existing AV and data equipment coverage on commercial auto. It may later be added to coverages on personal auto and homeowners policy types. First, I determine what I need to create. Looking at the commercial auto policy type. I see that there is an associated coverage type for audio visual and data equipment. I'll navigate to that coverage type. And look at its children. There is a coverage subtype that maps to the vehicle damage exposure type. This is not what is needed. So I navigate to the coverage type. coverage subtype. And I retire it. Note that I retire the coverage subtype, rather than the child exposure type. This is because the coverage subtype is a unique pairing of coverage type and exposure type. The exposure type, on the other hand, may be used by other coverage types, by another coverage subtypes. The requirement calls for a new electronics exposure type, so I navigate to the exposure type type list. Here I create a new exposure type. The value of the code property is electronics, with a small e. I append the underscore si suffix to mark this as a succeed insurance extension. The display name is electronics, with a capital E. The value of the code property. And the description is electronics damage or theft. An incident type is required. I select mobile property incident. For the exposure to be available to GOSU code, I must recompile the exposure type list now. Now I must map the coverage type to the exposure type with an appropriate coverage subtype. Returning to the coverage type. I create a new child node. I give it the code BAElectronics, with the si underscore suffix. The name is BAElectronics Theft or Damage. The new coverage subtype appears in red, indicating that there is an error in its configuration. A description of the error appears below, telling us that the coverage subtype needs to be connected to an exposure type. So I will connect the coverage subtype to an exposure. I have already created the electronics exposure type, so there is no need to create a new type code. I click select type code. And select the electronics exposure type. This removes the error. Now I have to configure the helper object called exposure UI. I expand the GSRC node. And the libraries node. And open exposure UI. I need to add the electronics exposure type to this block of logic, which creates a new incident when the exposure is created. This logic is triggered when the exposure type is one of a list of exposure types. So I select one of them and copy it. Then I place the cursor at the beginning of the line in the block of exposures. And paste the line I copied. Now I simply change the exposure type to TC underscore electronics underscore SI. And paste the line in the block of the UI. And paste the line in the block of the UI. At this point it is a good idea to explicitly save my work. I need to display the details of the incident type. I drill down on page configuration. PCF. Claim. And new exposure. Exposure. I look at the existing general damage mode of the new exposure detail view. It contains the data needed for the electronics exposure. So I copy it. And paste a copy into the same node. I type the name of the mode, electronics underscore SI. And save the new PCF file. Once again, I'll save my work. Now I start the server in debug mode. When it is started, I navigate to Claim Center to test my configurations. I log in as Andy Applegate. I will search for a commercial auto claim. I'm searching for an insured company named Bison Trucking. One claim appears, so I select it. Now I'll use the Actions menu to see if I can create a new exposure for the electronics coverage type. The BA Electronics Theft or Damage Coverage subtype is available. It appears under A because the parent coverage name begins with A. This coverage subtype is its only child, so it gets promoted and appears under A. I create the exposure, and the new exposure electronics screen appears. This ends the configuring lines of business demonstration.",
