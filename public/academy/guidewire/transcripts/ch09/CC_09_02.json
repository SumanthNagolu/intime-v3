  "full_text": "At Succeed Insurance, sometimes a payment submitted by an adjuster exceeds the limit imposed by the policy for that exposure type. There are often good reasons for this, but when it occurs, the group's supervisor must investigate and verify that the payment issued is reasonable and appropriate. A rule must be created to implement this requirement. To save time, I have already created such a rule. It is a transaction set pre-update rule. This is the rule, Exposure Payments Beyond Limit. The condition for this rule ensures that the rule fires only when a check set is submitted, not a reserve or recovery transaction set. To meet this requirement I use a financials calculations engine that obtains total payments. The rule looks at each exposure in the transaction set. For each exposure, it determines whether the amount being paid for the exposure is greater than the limit for that exposure. If it is, the rule creates an exposure limit exceeded activity. It then assigns that activity to the supervisor of the group assigned. It is a validating rule. There is a validating rule. There is a validating rule that would interfere with the function of my new rule. It rejects transaction sets that would bring the total payments for an exposure above the exposure's limit. This would mean that my pre-update rule would never fire. I will simply disable the rule for the purposes of this demonstration. Now I will start the Claim Center Server. In debug mode. When the server is ready, I will start the Claim Center Server. In debug mode. I will start the Claim Center Server. In debug mode. I log in as Andy Applegate. Now I will start a new claim to test the rule. I'll use today's date. I need a policy with a good set of exposure limits. Most of the time I will start the Claim Center Server. In debug mode. Most homeowners policies meet this requirement. I'll use the Kandarian policy. Let's look at the policy details. There is one location on the policy. Looking at the coverages for that location. I note a personal property coverage, with an exposure limit of $50,000 and an incident limit of $75,000. Now I'll return to the main sequence. the wizard. For the reporter, I'll select the main insured party. Mr. Darien informs us that his house has been vandalized. An intruder spray-painted his living room walls, including a Dali painting. The loss causes malicious mischief and vandalism. Damage has been done to the dwelling. Particularly, rude words, spray painted on the wall of the living room. Mr. Darien has already gotten estimates for repairs to the damage. There is also damage to personal property in the form of the painting. The painting will require extensive restoration. This is related to the property contents incident. I will add one service. For purposes of this claim, the painting counts as furniture. We definitely want the painting restored. The work will be done by Stan's Restoral Service, the best in the Chicago area. I will add Stan's Restoral Service as a company vendor. Theountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountount This completes the service request. The base configuration of Claim Center does not automatically create exposures for homeowners' policies, so I will create one for the painting. The claimant for the exposure is Kentarian. I'll assign the claim to myself. Now the claim is complete. I'll visit the claim and add a reserve. There is only one exposure. This reserve is for claim cost. Its purpose is to pay for the restoral of the painting. Stan's Restoral has given us an estimate of $60,000. Recall that the limit for personal property exposures is $50,000. A reserve this big will obviously require high-level approval. So I will log out as Andy Applegate. And log in as the supervisor. I'll search for the claim I just created. Looking at the work plan for the claim, I see that there is an activity to approve the reserve. By logging in as the supervisor I'm skipping several levels to the level that would ultimately approve the reserve of this size. This seems like a reasonable estimate for such a delicate restoral job. Though it exceeds the exposure limit, it is within the incident limit, so I approve it. Now I'll log back in as Andy Applegate and create the check that will test the rule. First, I must return to the claim I created. Now I create a new check. The check will go to Stan's Restoral Service. This is the only payment that will be made on this reserve. So, it is a final payment. The payment is in the amount of $60,000. I will log in as Andy Applegate. Like the reserve, the check requires approval at the supervisory level. So I log out as Andy Applegate. And, once again, log in as the supervisor. I navigate to the claims work plan. There is an activity to approve the check. I simply approve it. And the activity created by the rule is present. The rule is working properly. This concludes the transaction set pre-update rules demonstration.",
