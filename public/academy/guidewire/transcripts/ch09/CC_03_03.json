  "full_text": "At Succeed Insurance, there is a concern that the loss details step of the FNEL wizard for automobile claims is too long and may be an inconvenience for users. I'll start a simple auto claim to show you. We can see that the screen does not fit easily on most monitors. To mitigate this, it has been decided to move the At The Scene section to a separate screen. Fortunately for this demo, the At The Scene section appears only in the default mode of the Loss Details screen, that is, for auto losses. So I will have to make sure that the At The Scene screen appears only for auto claims. First, I need a pair of display keys for the screen I'm creating. One for the screen label, and one for the screen title. I'll give them the SI, for Succeed Insurance, prefix. The label simply names the screen. The title appears at the top of the wizard step and shows the step number and the total number of steps. The next thing I need, is a screen that contains just the At The Scene section. The easiest way to do this, is to copy the default mode of the Loss Details step. Paste a new copy. And give it a new name, making sure to remove the default mode from the name. The next thing I need, is to copy the Loss Details screen. Now I'll remove everything except the toolbar in the At The Scene panel. Now I'll open the default mode of the Loss Details step. And remove the At The Scene panel. Now in the Fnull wizard itself. I need a new step after the Loss Details step. I'll copy the existing Loss Details step as a sort of template, and modify it. I'll paste the copy. Directly below the original. In the Screen property, I'll replace the Loss Details screen with the At The Scene screen. For the title and label properties, I will use the display keys I created earlier.

Now I will clear a few properties of the Lost Details step that the much simpler at the scene step does not need. The at the scene step should be available and visible only for auto claims. Now I can test my work in the user interface. First I will press Alt Shift L to refresh the PCF files. To test the changes I have made to the wizard, I create a new claim. In the Policy Number field, I enter a known personal auto policy. In the Date field I select today's date. When I click Search, because the search returns a single policy, it is automatically selected, and its details displayed. And the at the scene step is visible, though I cannot navigate to it yet. Moving on to the next step. I'll quickly select a reporter. In the next step, I'll enter a description. And select a lost cause. And a location.  Now I can navigate to the at the scene step by clicking Next. The step looks right so this part of the test is successful. I don't need to go any further with this claim. So I'll cancel it and continue testing. To verify that the step only appears for auto claims, I will begin to create a workers' compensation claim. I enter the policy number of a known workers' compensation policy. And select today's date. Now when I click Search, The at the scene step is not visible, which is as it should be. So I'll cancel the claim. In a real implementation, I would test against other policy types, including commercial auto, where the step should appear, and any other policy types offered by the insurer, where the step should not appear. But for the purpose of this demonstration, we are done. This concludes the configuring the FNEL wizard demonstration. At Succeed Insurance, there is a concern that the lost details step of the FNEL wizard for automobile claims is too long and may be an inconvenience for users. I'll start a simple auto claim to show you. So, so              so so so       so    so  so so            so  so      so     so   so   so    so       Thank you.
