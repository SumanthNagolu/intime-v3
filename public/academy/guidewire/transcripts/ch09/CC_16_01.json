  "full_text": "Succeed Insurance requires that, for any fatalities on a claim, the adjuster responsible for the claim should contact the next of kin and extend condolences on behalf of Succeed, as well as providing reassurance that Succeed Insurance will handle the claim quickly and fairly. I'll log in as the system administrator, who has permission to create and update business rules. Now, I navigate to the Business Activity Rules screen. Here, I create a new rule. The name of the new rule is Contact Next of Kin. The rule should test every exposure on a claim, so I select Exposure as the trigger entity. This will occur every time an exposure is created or updated. The rule should apply to every policy type except workers' compensation. So I click Business Owners. Then scroll down and Shift-click Professional Liability to select everything in between. And I move them to the selected box. I'll create a variable to make the rule more readable. The name of the variable is Severity. And it refers to the severity of the specific incident. I need to display the rule conditions if I want to create one. There is only one condition, but it must be enforced, so I select all of the following. The condition is going to be based on the severity variable. The severity must be a fatality for the rule to trigger, so I'll select the equal operator. And set the right expression to death. Finally, the rule has to do something. Specifically, it will generate an activity. The activity pattern, a custom pattern which I have already created, is Contact Next of Kin for fatality. I want this activity to show on the adjuster's calendar as a top priority. I also want to ensure that no more than one Contact Next of Kin activity is created against any single exposure. The rule is complete, so I will save it. Now I will re-enter the rule. This allows me to promote the rule first to Staged. And then to Approved Status. Now that the rule is created, I will test it by creating a claim with the fatality involved. I will log in as IDA Belt, a customer service representative. As IDA, I will create a new claim. I will search for the Brittany Turner account. And I will set the loss date to today. Ms. Turner reports the accident herself. Her only insured vehicle is involved. Ms. Turner hit another car while turning left out of her own driveway. She acknowledges that she is at fault. Moving on. Nothing is required here. Or here. Ms. Turner is distressed because her passenger was killed in the collision. So IDA creates a new exposure for bodily injury liability. The injury incident must be added to the exposure. The injury incident requires an injured person. Her name is Crystal Smith. I'll add a few more details. Though severity is not a required field, it is needed to trigger the business rule. Again, just a few more required details to finish out the exposure. As the injured party, Crystal Smith is the claimant. And now that the exposure is complete. I can finish the claim. I can finish the claim. And visit it. Where I see that the Contact Next of Kin activity has been added to the work plan. This concludes the Creating and Testing and Activity Business Rule demonstration.
