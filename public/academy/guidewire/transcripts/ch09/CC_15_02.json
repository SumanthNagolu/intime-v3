  "full_text": "The Security Dictionary provides useful, detailed information about the permission structure in ClaimCenter. I'll start by looking at System Permissions. Permissions related to activities begin with the letters ACT. The ActCreate permission is a good example. ActCreate is an object-based permission with a description, permission to create new activities. Eight roles use this System Permission. One of these is a System Permission. is the All Permissions, or Super User, role. ActCreate is a member of one Application Permission Key, or APK, Claim.CreateActivity. And it is related to one page, new activity, through that APK. In ClaimCenter Studio, I see that new activities can visit property calls the APK that includes ActCreate. Looking at the ActOwnSystem permission. It has the same layout, but with different details. For example, it belongs to the Activity.onAPK. And it is related to not one but three pages. If I click the Vacation Activities page link, I see that its Visit Permission expression includes the Activity.onAPK. In fact, the Edit and Visit Permission expressions are identical. In Studio, the CanEdit expression is void. This is because one implicitly includes the other. If you can't visit the page you obviously can't edit it, so a separate CanEdit expression would be needed. Only if it were more restrictive than the CanEdit property. Now I'll look at roles in the Security Dictionary. As I mentioned earlier, the Super Users All Underscore Permissions role includes all System permissions. But the Activity Rules Viewer role has only one permission, the right to view Business Rules. If I click the Permission, I see that several roles include this permission. That's pretty much all there is. That's pretty much all there is to roles. A role is just a list of permissions. There's a slight quirk to the Pages section of the Security Dictionary. It includes more than just pages. It includes all PCF files in the application, including things like screens and views, neither of which require permissions, because they inherit them from their parent pages. So perhaps it should really be called a PCF instead of pages. The main reason for this is that some non-page PCFs, like popups and forwards do have permission expressions. For example, the Activity Detail Forward requires the Activity View APK. Finally, on in the Application Permission Key section of the Security Dictionary, I can select an APK and see the permissions it conveys and the pages that use it. Some APKs have an additional reference type. Element references list elements, such as widgets, in PCFs that use the APK or permission in their available properties. For example, the Activity View APK is used to determine whether the subject cell of some activities list views is available. This concludes the Security Dictionary demonstration.
