  "full_text": "Succeed Insurance has two requirements that will require assignment by rules. The first requirement is that claims with a lost location in Quebec should be assigned to a French speaking agent. The best way to accomplish this is by using user attributes. Before I can use a rule to assign a claim to a French speaker, I need to create a French speaking attribute and associate it with the user. On the attribute administration page, I add an attribute. I'll name the attribute French. Give it a description. And mark it as type language. Our French language speaker is Heidi Johnson. On Heidi's attributes tab. On Heidi's attributes tab. I'll add the French attribute to her attributes list. I'll add the French attribute to her attributes list. I'll log out a super user. Then I will be ready to create the assignment rule that completes the implementation of this requirement. Since it assigns a claim to a specific user, this will be a default group claim assignment rule. So I will create a new rule.  So I will create a new rule.  So I will create a new rule. purposes, I need it to fire before the built-in rules. For the condition, I want this rule to fire if the claim's lost location is in Quebec. The rule action is a bit more complex. To assign by attributes, I need a list of criteria. This is implemented as an entity called attribute-based assignment criteria, which I will create as a variable here. Each criterion is implemented as an attribute criteria element. I will create one and call it French speaker. I need to set its values based on what I created in the administrative data. The type of the attribute is language. I need to set its values based on what I created in the administrative data. The type of the attribute is language. I put French in the name field. I need to set its values based on what I created in the assigned group. Now I can add the criteria element to the attribute criteria. If a French speaker is found in the assigned group, the rule will assign the claim to that user. If you need to excel within the triangles, you need to excel within the triangles.  If you need to excel within the triangles, you need to excel within the triangles. If you need to excel within the triangles, you need to excel within the triangles. If you need to excel within triangles, you need to excel within triangles. If you need to excel within triangles, you need to excel within triangles. If you need to excel within triangles, you need to excel within triangles triangles. If you need to excel within triangles triangles, you need to excel within triangles triangles triangles,    and exit the rule set. If no French speaker is found, the rule will assign the claim to the group's supervisor. The rule is complete. To test it, I restart the Claim Center server. When the server is started, I log in as Andy Applegate. Now I'll navigate to one of my claims. And change the lost location to the province of Quebec, in Canada. I'll also have to change the city. From the Actions menu, I'll reassign the claim. Heidi Johnson, the French speaker, has been correctly assigned. Not all rule-based assignments are performed in the assignment rules. The work plan rules create and assign activities when a claim, exposure, or matter is created. The second requirement involves workers' compensation claims. When an agent creates a workers' comp claim, the Claim Center-based configuration creates three three-point contact activities, which are assigned to the claim owner. Succeed Insurance wants the activity for contacting the medical provider to be assigned to the claim creator, so that the preliminary medical details can be completed as quickly as possible. So I'll change the assignment to the assigned user, to the claims creating user. To test my work, I'll restart the server. When the server is fully started, I log in as Andy Applegate. Here, I create a new worker's compensation claim. I will search for the insured company, Hard Hat Construction, and select Today as the law state. When I click Search, Claim Center returns a single relevant policy, so I click Next to continue. The reporter is a new person. I'll input their name and social security number. In this case, the injured worker reported their own injury. I'll quickly enter some minimal details about the accident. the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident of the incident I will use automatic assignment. Since Andy Applegate is in an auto group, he will not be assigned to a workers compensation claim. The claim is assigned to Darlene Olson, an adjuster in a comp group. However, when I view the claims work plan, I see that the claim has been assigned to Andy Applegate, the claim creator. This concludes the assignment methods demonstration.",
