  "full_text": "Next demonstration, I'm going to explore and show what roles and permissions do in terms of access to various aspects of the application. I will use three users, Rick Ralston, a claims supervisor, Ida Belt, a customer service representative, and the system administrator. As you will see, each user has access to different areas of the application, relative to their job responsibilities. I'll start with Rick. Since he's a supervisor, Rick has access to the team tab. Next, let's look at claim ownership. As Rick, I create a new claim. As Rick, I'll put together a quick auto claim to demonstrate. Let's suppose Mr. Williams hit a moose coming out of his garage. I'll add the vehicle Mr. Williams was driving. I'll add the vehicle to the vehicle. Finally, Rick assigns the claim to Ida Belt. Rick searches for Ida's user ID. Rick clicks Assign. But when he attempts to save the claim, he sees that Ida does not have permission to own claims. So instead, he assigns the claim to NDApplegate, an adjuster. Now he can finish and save the claim. I'll take note of the claim number for later use. Then, as Rick, navigate to the claim. On the contacts page, Rick has the ability to edit contacts in the address book. Rick also has the ability to close a claim. Now let's look at Ida. Ida does not have access to the team tab. Ida does not have access to the team tab. Ida can search for a claim. Ida does not need to close the claim. Ida does not need to close the claim. Ida does not need to close the claim. Ida does not need to close the claim. But she cannot close the claim. She can view contacts, but she cannot edit them. Let's look at why she is restricted this way. A login is the system administrator. Let's start by looking at IDA's user record. Users have roles. IDA has exactly one role, Customer Service Representative. Andy Applegate, on the other hand, has two roles, Adjuster Entrusted for Sensitive Claims, and Rick Ralston. Has the single role of Claim Supervisor. Let's look at these three roles. Let's start with the Claim Supervisor roles. A role is basically a list of permissions. A user who has a role assigned to them has every permission associated with that role. If the user has two or more roles, they have all permissions associated with any of those roles. The Claim Supervisor role has 12 pages of permissions associated with it. Among these are the right to close claims, to create contacts, to edit contacts, and to view their team. Adjusters, on the other hand, have the permission to own claims. But Customer Service Representatives do not have any of those permissions. This concludes the permissions in the base application demonstration. of the DSA of the DSA of the DSA of the DSA of the DSA of the DSA of the DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA of DSA D Thank you.",
