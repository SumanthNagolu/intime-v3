  "full_text": "The ClaimCenter line of business model consists of six specialized type lists. The highest level of these type lists is loss type. The loss type ties together policies, coverages, and claims that deal with similar losses. In the base application, there are five loss types, auto, general liability, property, travel, and workers' compensation. Next is the LOB code, or line of business code, type list. This type list is more granular than loss type, and is mostly used for reporting purposes. It has a many to one relationship to loss type. That is, many LOB codes may refer to the same loss type. For example, the commercial property line and the homeowner's line both refer to the property loss type. The policy type type list refers to the same loss type. The coverage type type type list of specific products offered by an insurer. This has a many-to-many relationship to LOB code. That is, one policy type may refer to one or more LOB codes, and any given LOB code may refer back to one or more policy types. For example, the commercial package policy type. And the commercial property policy type both refer to the commercial property line of business. The commercial package policy type also refers to other lines of business. The coverage type type list. specifies something that a policy may indemnify. Again, this is in a many-to-many relationship with policy type. I'm going to skip to the sixth type list, exposure type, for a moment. Recall that an exposure is a pairing of a coverage and a claimant, which tracks potential payments for a claim. The exposure type in the LOB model determines the information to gather about each exposure. The coverage subtype is essentially a mapping between one coverage type and one exposure type. That is, it says this type of coverage can cover this type of exposure. The mapping need not be unique. The same coverage type and exposure type can be paired by more than one coverage subtype to handle different circumstances. Now, let's take a look at how the type lists of the line of business model work together in the data dictionary. Let's navigate down the list of type lists. To coverage type, which is a fairly typical example. Scrolling down, we can see a rather large collection of type codes. If we navigate to a typical type code, we see that each type code has a set of categories associated with it. These refer downward in the line of business model to the coverage subtype, and also upward to the policy type. Knowing whether a given category item refers upward or downward depends on familiarity with the line of business model. There is also a category for source system, the system from which the data about coverage types comes. This is typically a policy administration system. This appears on all the LOB types except loss type and exposure type. This is because loss type and exposure type are unique to claim center, while the other components of the LOB model are typically populated from an insurer's PAS, such as policy center. You can easily navigate from one level of the hierarchy to another by clicking on these categories. I'll navigate down to the coverage subtype, then back up to the coverage type, from there to a policy type. Commercial package has a lot of coverage types, but we'll continue on up to one of its associated LOB codes, and on up to a loss type. Now let's see how these lists are configured in Studio. If I expand a typical coverage type node, this one is accounts receivable for off-premises property. I see that it has three nodes beneath it, children, parents, and other categories. Expanding them. I see that these are the same categories I saw in the data dictionary. I'm currently looking at this in the line of business tab. If I switch to the type list tab, and expand a typical node. It just lists related type lists, without any division between the various types of category. Looking at the incoming categories tab, and expanding a node. I see that coverage subtype and policy type are not the only type lists that refer to coverage type. Cove term pattern, cost category, and line category all refer to this entry. While in the outgoing categories tab, we see that coverage subtypes, and policy types are visible here, but no others, because coverage type does not refer out or to any other type lists. Except, of course, for source system. This is not true for all line of business type lists. Policy type, for example, refers not only to lob code, coverage type, and source system, but to policy tab, but to policy tab, and internal policy type. Looking at loss type, it only has a children node, no parents or other categories nodes. Similarly, in the exposure type type code, there are parents and other categories nodes, but no children node. The other category here is an incident. An incident type is required for all exposure types. This concludes the exploring line of business type lists demonstration.",
