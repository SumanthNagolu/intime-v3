  "full_text": "Succeed Insurance needs service types for fire and water slash mold restoral, associated with dwellings. Before starting, I want to make one important observation. Here and in the lab, we will do simple configuration by adding a few new services to the base configuration. In an actual implementation, you will probably rip out most or all of the sample service data provided in the base configuration and create completely new custom services. I will need several display keys to meet this requirement. I will save time by pasting them into the display.properties file. Now I will navigate to the VendorServiceTree.xml file, which creates the hierarchy of services and service categories. I am going to add a set of HomeRestoral services to the application at the end of the file. First, I will add a parent service type for HomeRestoral. This will be implemented, like all services, as a specialist service. The public ID will be H-Res, for HomeRestoral. The convention for services is to prefix the public ID with SVC and a colon. It will be active in the application. I will use HomeRestoral as its code. As its description. As its description. As its description. As its description. As its description. As its description. As its description. As its description. As its description. As its description. As its description.      As its description.    As its description.       As its description. As its description. As its description. As its description.   As its description. As its description. As its description.  As its description.  As its description. As its description. This is a top level category and has no parent, but the parent field is required, so I'll enter it as an alt tag. This completes the definition of the parent service, so I'll add a closing tag. To save time, I'll paste the fire and water slash mold services. Now I can save and close this file. For the services to display in the user interface, they must be implemented in the VendorServiceDetails.xml file, which creates the associations between service kinds, or categories, and incidents, and between services and service kinds. Service requests are associated with incident types at the bottom of the file. Services must be associated with incident types to appear in the user interface. In this file, the public IDs are implemented as numbers, so I will use the number 1 greater than the last incident type. The incident type for these services is Dwelling Incident. The service type to associate this incident with is the Home Restoreal type I created. Its public ID is hres. The service type to associate this incident with the service type. And, a closing tag. That ends this association. Now I need to associate the two services with their service kind. The surrounding tag for this association is Specialist Service Compatible Service Request Kind. Again, the public ID number is 1 greater than the last number already in place for service request kinds. The service kind is to quote and perform the service. To complete the association, I enter the tag for the service.  And, once again, a closing tag. To speed things along, I'll paste the water and mold service kind association. I'll save the file. This time, I'll close the editor. Now I'll start the Claim Center server. Now, I'll log in as the system administrator to import the new services. On the Administration page, I click Utilities in the sidebar. The Import Data screen is displayed. I browse to find the service data files I edited. The service tree must be imported first. Since no conflicts are found, I click Finish. The file was successfully imported, so I click Utilities to refresh the Data Import screen. Now I will import the service details file. Now, to test my work, I navigate to a known homeowner's claim. From the Actions menu, I begin to create a new service request. I look at the list of services to add. And here I see the services I added displayed correctly. This concludes the configuring services demonstration.",
