  "full_text": "ClaimCenter search is flexible and useful in the base configuration. While you can configure it, most of your day-to-day needs are already met. The most commonly searched for entity is claim. The simple search for claims is quite powerful. For example, if I can only remember a claimant's first name, that will be enough to obtain results. Of course, a search like that would not be very useful if I were looking at the claimant's first name. For example, if I can only search for a common name in a large database. This is where advanced search comes in handy. For example, if I know that the loss date was in April of 2018, I can limit the search to that month. I'll restrict the search to claims whose loss date is in the period beginning April 1st of 2018. And ending on April 30th of the same year. Now when I click search, it only finds one claim in that period with a claimant named Ray. On the other hand, suppose that I don't remember the dates. But I do know that there is about $16,000 in reserves still unpaid. To be safe, I'll bracket that $16,000 from $15,000 to $20,000. Again, a restricted list of claims is displayed, different from the previous one. What if I use both criteria? That is, if I look for a claim from April of 2018, with a claimant named Ray and $15,000 to $20,000 in remaining reserves? I get no results at all. Now, what happens if I repeat the search without Ray in the first name field? The search fails. There are a set of criteria on the left-hand side of the search, which constitute the required criteria. No individual criterion in this set is required, but at least one of them must be specified for the search to proceed. As long as at least one of the required criteria are met, I can add any combination of other criteria. For example, I select a group, only groups to which I belong are displayed initially. I'll also constrain the search by jurisdiction of California. And change the date option back to sense. And, finally, I remove all financial value restrictions. Now when I click search, I get all the claims, less than a year old, that my team is responsible for in California. There are only about 10, because the sample data is fairly small. If I click print export, I can export these results as a PDF for printing, or as a CSV to use in a spreadsheet program. The other search menu options, activity, check, recovery, and bulk invoice, work in the same way. So do user in group search from the functional and administrative pages, except that there are no required fields there. The one that is a little different is contact search. I'll navigate to an open claim. If I create a new service request, I'll associate the service with this MedPay exposure. The only service available for a MedPay exposure in the base configuration is medical care. Now I'll search the address book application for a doctor. The search returns a list of doctors and medical care organizations, located near the address of the claim. I could select any of these, and they would be populated in the claim. But now I will cancel the search. And the service request. This concludes the searching for entities demonstration.
