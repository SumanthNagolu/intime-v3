  "full_text": "A supplemental payment is a payment issued against a closed exposure. It is not uncommon for a supplemental payment to occur shortly after an exposure is closed. For example, an injury exposure might issue a payment of $7,000, but, after the exposure is closed, the doctor determines that the initial treatment should be followed by a secondary procedure. In this case, a supplemental payment may be issued against the exposure for the second procedure. At Succeed Insurance, it is highly unusual for a supplemental payment to be issued a year or more after the exposure is closed, but it does happen, particularly for injuries whose long-term impact is not known when the claim is processed. Consequently, Succeed wants to allow supplemental payments against exposures closed for a year or more, but these payment require approval by the group supervisor. This requirement will best be met by a transaction approval rule. None of the existing rules can be easily modified. The rule should be modified to meet this requirement, so I will create a new rule. I give the rule a number and an appropriate name. The rule should only be active for check sets, not reserve sets. The rule should only be active for check sets, not reserve sets. I will set a variable for the maximum number of days after the exposure closes that a supplemental payment can be made without approval. Note that, if we expected this to change a lot, I would probably use a script parameter. It must inspect each payment in the check set. If a transaction is supplemental, the exposure has been closed longer than 364 days. Then approval is required. Now, you might think that I would need to find an exposure that closed more than a year ago to test this rule. But since I used a variable for the number of days, I can test it much more easily. If I set its value to minus 1, then all supplemental payments will require approval. Now I'll restart the server in debug mode. And login is an adjuster. I navigate to a claim. And close in exposure. I'll verify that there are no open activities on the exposure. There are none. Now, I create a supplemental payment against that exposure. The claimant on this exposure is Stan Newton. I select the MedPay reserve line for the exposure I closed. Because this is a closed exposure, the only payment type available is supplement. Stan requires physical therapy for lingering effects of his injuries. Now I'll enter the amount and finish out the payment. I see that the payment, which is well within my authority limits, requires approval. Looking at the claims work plan. The approval activity has been assigned to Sue Smith, my immediate supervisor. This shows that the rule is working. The next step is to change the max up days variable back to 364 so that the rule will function according to the requirement. This ends the transaction approval rules demonstration.

Consequently, Succeed wants to allow supplemental payments against exposures closed for a year or more, but these payment require approval by the group supervisor. This requirement will best be met by a transaction approval rule. None of the existing rules can be easily modified.",
