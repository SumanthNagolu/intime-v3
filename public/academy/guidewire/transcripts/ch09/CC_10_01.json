  "full_text": "As Andy Applegate, I need to create three payments on the Karen Egertsen claim. Looking at the financials for the claim, I can see that several reserves have been created, and a few payments have already been made. The first payment I need to make is for auto repair. I have an invoice for $2,382.87, and I see that there is a reserve of $2,500. available for this. Navigating to the reserve. I will create a check for the invoice amount. The information about the payee is already provided, since it's associated with the exposure and incident. I select the payment type. I select the payment type. Which is final. And the cost category. Which is other. And enter the amount. $2,382.87. At this point I would typically link the payment to the invoice, but since there is no invoice for this reserve in the database. I'm done with this check, so I click finish. This check does not yet have a check number. This is because the check is awaiting submission to the check processing application. That application will assign a number to the check, and communicate that number back to Claim Center. The check is awaiting submission because I have the authority to approve a check of this amount. If I did not, it would be awaiting approval. Now I'm going to enter another check. This check covers physical therapy associated with Ms. Egertsen's injuries. There is a reserve of $12,000 set aside for medical expenses, of which $9,000 has already been paid. Ms. Egertsen has received a bill for $2,300. So I'll access the reserve. And create a check. Once again, I will just bypass this first screen. I'll make the payment final. Set the category to physical therapy. And enter the amount of $2,300. This check, too, is awaiting submission. Finally, I need to process a payment to a third party. There are $4,700 remaining on this reserve line, and I have been hand a bill for $2,000. The third party is Bob Smith. The third party will be approved for the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of treatment of treatment of treatment of treatment of treatment of treatment of treatment of treatment of treatment of treatment of treatment treatment of treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment treatment $2,000. The status of this check is pending approval. While I have the authority to approve a check of this size, the total checks for this claim have exceeded my authority, so the check must be approved by my manager. This concludes the transaction approval demonstration.",
