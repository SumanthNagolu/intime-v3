  "full_text": "I have been given a requirement that automatic approvals should be limited to $1,000 and automatic payments should be limited to $1,500. I can meet this requirement by configuring straight through invoice processing, or STIP. To accomplish this, I need to edit two files. The first is Invoice Auto Approval Helper. And the second is Invoice Auto Payment Helper. Invoice Auto Approval Helper has a useful property called Small Amount Thresholds. The Get Failed to Qualify Reasons function produces a list of reasons why an invoice might not qualify for automatic approval. If none of these apply, the list is empty and the invoice is automatically approved. Get Failed to Qualify Reasons has a clause, in the base configuration, that tests the amount of an invoice against small amount threshold and adds an entry to the list if it exceeds that threshold. So, all I need to do to meet the first part of the requirement, is to change the value of small amount threshold. The Auto Payment Helper does not have this functionality in the base configuration. So I will copy the property from the Invoice Auto Approval Helper. And paste it into the Invoice Auto Payment Helper. And paste it into the Invoice Auto Payment Helper. Small amount threshold uses a package, big decimal, not used in the base configuration of Invoice Auto Payment Helper. I click OK to approve importing the package. I change the US currency value to meet the requirement. I also have to arrange for Invoice Auto Payment Helper to use the property. So I return to the Auto Approval Helper. Copy the clause I need. And paste it into the Auto Payment Helper. I paste it at the bottom of the Get field to qualify reasons function, right before the return statement. Now I see that this clause uses a variable which has not been created in this helper. So I return to the Approval Helper. And copy the line that instantiates the variable. There is more logic associated with this variable, but this one line will suffice for this demonstration. Then I return to the Payment Helper. And I paste the line immediately before the line where the variable is needed. This concludes the configuration. Now I will start the server to test my work. A proper test involves at least 3 services. One below $1,000, which should be automatically approved and paid. One above $1,500, which should require manual approval and manual payment. And one between those two values, which should require manual approval and then be automatically paid. Due to time constraints, I will only demonstrate the last of these. I log in as Andy Applegate. First, I will navigate to a Claims Financials screen. Reserve Line 2 has $4,700 of remaining reserves available, and will be perfect for this test. I also observe that the line is for auto body work. I will create a new service. I relayed the service to the Reserve Line I chose. This will be a quote in Perform Service Request. The service to perform is auto body repair. I'll finish up the required fields. And I submit the service request. After a while, the auto shop provides a quote. The quote totals $1,000. 750 for parts. And 250 for labor. The quote is waiting for approval. So I approve it. The vendor completes the work and sends in an invoice. I'll fill in the invoice details. The parts came in right on target. But the cost of labor was higher than expected. The status of the invoice is waiting for approval. The reason it is waiting for approval is because the amount is too high. That is, it exceeds the $1,000 I set in the approval helper. So I approve the invoice. The check is immediately created. This is because I set the small amount threshold to $1,500 in the payment helper. This concludes the STIP demonstration.",
