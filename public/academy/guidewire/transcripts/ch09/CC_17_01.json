  "full_text": "Succeed Insurance wants to automatically create a liability when there is an injury in a building covered by a business owner's policy. I am logged into ClaimCenter as a user with administrative rights, and navigate to the Exposure Rules page. There is already an exposure rule related to business owner's policies. Clicking on it, I see that it creates an exposure for building coverage. This rule will not meet my requirement. So I will create a new rule. I'll give the rule a number indicating that this is the first Succeed Insurance Exposure Rule, and then name it Business Owner's Injury Liability. The description field is not mandatory, but is very helpful when someone else has to figure out what the rule does. The trigger incident and trigger action are fixed. The rule will trigger at the creation of a new incident. I want the rule to be enabled, which is the default value. Now we get a bit more specific. I need this rule to apply to injury incidents on business owners' policies. So, I'll set these fields accordingly. I can select specific loss causes, or allow the rule to apply to all loss causes. I can also select what type of parties this rule applies to. And the loss type. I can also restrict the rule to apply to specific jurisdictions. I could also add rule variables. And conditions, but neither are needed for this business requirement. Finally, I need the rule to create an exposure. There is a list of coverage types available. I'll choose Liability. In the base configuration, there is only one coverage subtype available for coverage type liability on a business owner's policy. The rule is complete so I click Save. This returns me to the Exposure Rules page. I click to go back to the rule. Now I can stage the rule. And approve it. To test my rule I will create a new business owner's claim. There are no business owner's policies in the sample database, so I create an unverified policy. I give the policy a legitimate policy number. Select business owner's policy type. And set the loss date to today. The policy needs to be effective on the loss date. So I set the effective date to the beginning of last month. And the expiration date to one year, less a day. I'll give the policy a little bit later. For the insured party, I create a new company. I'll call the company C Bright Lighting. I'll give it an address. And use Autofill to populate the state, county, and zip code. The company needs a contact person. All I need here is a name. Finally, I need a liability coverage so there can be a liability exposure. I'll set some reasonable limits. That completes the policy, so I click next. Let's keep it simple. Sandy Stone called us. Sandy slipped on a wet floor and hit their head on a piece of furniture. Sandy is an agent who represents the company, not an employee, so this is not a workers' comp claim. There was no sign warning of the wet floor. Now I'll add the injury incident. Sandy is the injured party. This is a third party loss. The injury is of moderate severity. Sandy was briefly knocked unconscious. By definition, if you're knocked unconscious, you've sustained at least a mild concussion. That completes the injury incident. And when I move to the last page of the claim wizard, an exposure of tight bodily injury and coverage liability has been created. This concludes the creating and testing and exposure business rule demonstration.",
