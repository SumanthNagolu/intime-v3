You'll be able to describe the various phases of a Guidewire Short-Part Implementation project. You will be able to differentiate between cloud and self-managed projects. Describe the teams involved in each phase, understand their roles and responsibilities, and how they interact. Understand how organizational change management is implemented, and how these aspects are implemented. the project of the project is managed. This module will review the project phases typically found during a Guidewire implementation, and how they map to the customer journey with Guidewire. We'll look at the typical teams involved and identify some key Guidewire roles, both in self-managed and Guidewire cloud implementations. While OCM is not a role fulfilled by Guidewire, it is an important part of an implementation, so we'll briefly call it. As mentioned in the short path overview, for context, we will highlight which moments on the Guidewire Path to Success this module applies to. As this module is about the key phases of the Guidewire project lifecycle, it applies to mobilize and execute. These moments focus on setting up your program for success, and executing on the plan to build your solution, integrated with your ecosystem through to life, launch, and launch, which is the moment you go live with your launch, which is the moment you go live with your Guidewire solution. Each project phase includes activities, deliverables, and defined outcomes that pave the way for a successful implementation, all enabled by short path. Now, we have covered contextually where this module fits on the Guidewire path to success. Let's drill into the Guidewire project lifecycle that covers all project phases and their key activities. The Guidewire project lifecycle consists of seven phases. The pre-inception, inception, and sprint zero phases involve the preparatory work that mobilizes the project and sets the project up for success. Development and stabilization is about execution, where the work gets done, the solution is built, integrated into your ecosystem, and tested. The deployment prep is getting the solution ready to deploy to the production environment, and launch is when the solution goes live and is used by the customer. Following the launch phase, other teams will take responsibility for the production systems, support, and ongoing maintenance. While the methodology is based on Agile, each phase contains key activities and deliverables. Some of the activities shown here may span more than one phase, but are included in the phase where they should start and finish. The short path methodology includes collateral to help with every activity in each phase, and we'll discuss some of these shortly. During each phase, the implementation is tracked using project management disciplines. Guidewire's most experienced consultants provide guidance, and changes in the customer organization are managed to accept the Guidewire solution. The duration of a Guidewire implementation project varies significantly, depending on the customer's business objectives and drivers. Typically, the pre-development phases have weekly sprints, while sprints during the delivery phases are more likely to be 2 to 4 weeks in duration. Pre-Inception loosely spans the period between customer commitment and inception, which can be several weeks depending on project scope and duration. During this time, there will be some discovery and readiness activities to help prepare the customer, SI partner, and Guidewire teams. Inception duration varies depending on the Guidewire products to be implemented, the line of business and project scope. Guidewire policy center in-centred inception tend to be 6 to 8 weeks, with Guidewire billing center and Guidewire claim center inception lasting between 4 and 6 weeks. Inceptions for the integration work stream can last the longest, depending on the number of interfaces in scope. The duration of sprint 0 is usually 4 weeks. However, the duration is dependent on the complexity and size of the program. For follow-on releases, it can be shortened if changes to staffing and scope are minor. The time needed for development varies based on the scope of functionality, the number of integrations, the technical and environment complexities, and the implementation approach. An MVP project is shorter than a standard implementation. In addition, the usage of short-path content and pre-built solutions available on Guidewire marketplace can significantly reduce implementation effort and shorten the timeframe. Duration for policy center development can be as short as 2 months for an MVP, but typically lasts 8 to 10 months. Claim center and billing center developments are around 5 and 8 months, respectively. Stabilization is typically between 40 and 50% of the development phase duration, but will also depend on the testing strategy used during the development phase and whether it is an initial or follow-on release. Investing in behavioral-driven development and automated testing, as recommended by short-path, will pay back not only in a reduction of effort in the first release, but with less and less effort required in follow-on releases. Deployment preparation typically lasts 4 weeks for Guidewire cloud projects, but the duration can vary based on the customer-specific requirements for self-managed implementations. And finally, the duration of the launch phase varies significantly based on the deployment approach. For example, it may be a small pilot or rollout of jurisdictions, producers, or line of businesses. So, how do the implementation phases vary between self-managed and Guidewire cloud projects? Whether it's a self-managed or Guidewire cloud implementation, fundamentally, the project does not change. We still follow the seven phases. But the project work remains the same for both. The applications are configured, interfaces are built, products are upgraded, and the overall solution is tested and deployed. For Guidewire cloud, the only difference is that the cloud operations team supports the application infrastructure, manages the deployment, and of course, the customer goes live on Guidewire cloud. For both self-managed and Guidewire cloud implementations, delivery assessments are a recommended best practice across all project phases. There are two different components. Phase readiness assessments set up each project phase for success. Implementation assessments are split into execution and feature assessment. Execution assessment measures the adherence to best practice and optimal application performance, while feature assessment measures the use of short-path content, alignment to the base product functionality, and potential reductions in maintenance costs. When implementation moves between phases, there are well-defined quality gates that ensure the transition happens in a structured, robust, and ordered way to guarantee the quality of your implementation. Guidewire has documented entrance and exit criteria to help identify critical items that you should focus on when completing one phase and starting on the next. Each short path overview module will identify these criteria, split into three categories, Technology and Cloud, Scope and Planning, and Inputs and Outputs. Guidewire defines entrance criteria as the minimum critical set of items that should be in place before a phase should start. We recommend that all entrance criteria are completed before starting phase activities, to avoid costly downstream rework. Guidewire defines exit criteria as the items needed to identify a phase as complete. It is sometimes possible to overlap phases, and many situations might require tracking the completion of a phase as part of the governance model. If it looks like phase entry or exit criteria will not be met, there are techniques that can be applied to alleviate the impact. Example, adjusting staffing levels in the program, increasing the program funding, rescheduling, and developing mitigation plans to address the risk of failing criteria. So, what teams are typically involved across the project phases? The Guidewire ecosystem helps ensure focused use of consultants' time to better meet budget and scheduled demands. It helps maximize the value of the base product, provides assurance that there is enough of the right resources at the right time, and mitigate risks for customers to achieve success. Think of this ecosystem as six layers of dedicated support and expertise. Your core team of resources, whether on-site or remote, is your connection to the entire Guidewire ecosystem. Your core team will pull in the right resources and specialists at the right time, if and when you need them. The advisory team ensures that the implementation runs smoothly, performing delivery assessment or cloud assurance services, and measuring product and value alignment. The methodology and standards team support the implementation, providing delivery strategy and short-path expertise, while specialized services provide both functional and technical expertise with a mix of full and part-time resources. Guidewire's tool and knowledge bases enable the teams to call on the wider extended Guidewire services team, which has the experience of hundreds of implementations. And finally, the global enablement team, which has deep experience in implementing Guidewire products and is available when unique or complex issues arise. Of course, all these teams could be supplemented by resources from the customer and partner teams. So, what Guidewire teams should you expect to be involved during a self-managed implementation? Guidewire delivery services and SI partners will be a key part of the core team throughout the implementation. About 8 to 12 weeks before GoLive, the Guidewire support team will be engaged and have responsibility for supporting production after GoLive. Also, the responsibility for a customer's ongoing journey with Guidewire will transition to the Guidewire customer account manager or CAM team. The global enablement and extended services team will also be there throughout the majority of the phases. For Guidewire cloud customers, our delivery services and support teams remain the same, but additional teams will be added. The customer success team has responsibility for the Guidewire path to success. For existing customers who are aligned with self-managed instances, the Cloud Assurance team executes delivery assessments and manages the transition to the Guidewire cloud. The Cloud Assurance module in this course will provide more details on this team. The Cloud Operations team is responsible for managing the cloud infrastructure and environments, and the production services team manages upgrades and business as usual changes in Guidewire cloud. And, of course, this team could also be sourced from an SI partner. The various roles and responsibilities of the team members we just reviewed can be found in our White Paper. This document describes the skills and experience required for each role, including specific implementation roles for self-managed and Guidewire cloud projects. This paper is a key part of ShortPath Collateral and is available to partners and customers alike on Guidewire community. There are many important roles in a Guidewire implementation. Guidewire has created Collateral to help with this. Our role raises by defining which roles have responsibilities and accountability for the activities and interactions during a project, including who is consulted and informed . and who is consulted and who is consulted and who is consulted and who is consulted and who is consulted. These comprehensive raises are delivered as part of the ShortPath Collateral and are available to partners and customers alike on Guidewire community. One of the key roles in the implementation is preparing a customer's organization for the future business state. There may be many project work streams as part of a Guidewire implementation, for example, Program Management, Legacy System Development and Data Migration. All these work streams are supported with ShortPath Collateral where we can share our experience, even when the project is led by a customer or a partner. One of these work streams is Organizational Change Management or OCM. OCM is a systematic approach for accelerating sustainable business results by managing the people side of change. Essentially, it is getting the people ready to use the new Guidewire solution by focusing on stakeholder engagement, communication, training, change leadership, resistance management and organizational design. This is not a service that Guidewire offers, but many of our SI partners can provide these consulting services. We have created a white paper available on Guidewire community describing the things that a customer should consider when addressing OCM. In addition, through our Guidewire business optimization, we can do a high-level change assessment and provide custom recommendations to help you gain foundational change work that you can turn over to your selected System Integrator. That concludes this overview module for the ShortPath project phases. You are now familiar with the seven phases of the Guidewire implementation project, and now ShortPath is providing valuable assets for customers to achieve their business objectives and where to find those assets. The understanding of the Guidewire ecosystem will help you get in support during any of the project phases, including on OCM, even if it is not provided by Guidewire, but by an SI partner. All of those paved the way for a successful implementation, all enabled by ShortPath. Thank you for listening. This ShortPath overview course has provided you with a high-level understanding of what ShortPath is, and why it's a critical enabler for fast, predictable delivery on your Guidewire path to success. We have drilled into details as to how leveraging ShortPath will accelerate projects and accelerate value delivery without compromising quality or exceeding project budgets, making sure to leverage the power of Guidewire solutions in a way that's fully aligned with our standards. With at least two releases a year, we have also covered how ShortPath is continually evolving to enable adoption of new product capabilities, as well as infusing lessons learned from every implementation to ensure the content remains current, accurate, and relevant. Every project will benefit from using at least some aspects of ShortPath, including those led by customers and partners.
