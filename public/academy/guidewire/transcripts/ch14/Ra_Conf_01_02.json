  "full_text": "The quote page displays costs for individual coverages as well as the total premium and tax for the entire policy. Notice that the cost for the line coverage liability, bodily injury and property damage coverage is calculated per vehicle. The business need for rating the coverages drives the cost structure and cost entity configuration. Next, we'll look at how costs are configured in Guidewire Studio. We'll use Studio to examine examples of the cost entities used to store the monetary amount. All cost entities must implement the cost delegate, cost adapter and cost methods interfaces. They contain the necessary information used for rating or for display purpose. This is the PA cost entity which is the root entity for the costs in Personal Auto. Next, let's look at the cost delegate. Notice that the PA cost is implementing the cost. Next we'll click the implements interface. This cost entity implements the cost adapter interface. The concrete implementation for this interface is the PA cost adapter. Next, we'll look at the fields in the cost entity that are used to store rates and monetary amounts. To do this, we'll switch over to the data dictionary. Here we are viewing the data dictionary for the PA cost entity. Cost entities contain three significant columns, actual, standard, and override, to store rates and monetary amounts. So, the base base column of the base column of the base column. column. The last column in the standard set is the standard amount column. Next, we'll look at the override set of columns. This is the override base rate column. This is the override adjusted rate column. The override term amount column. And, this is the override amount column. Next, we'll look at the set of columns that hold the actual amounts. Actual base rate, actual adjusted rate, actual term amount, And finally, the Actual Amount column. Next, we'll switch back to Studio to look at some more cost entities. All other line-specific cost entities are subtypes of the root cost entity. Generally, there is a cost entity for each coverage entity. For example, the Personal AutoCov cost entity is for the line coverage. Double-click the entity. Click the Foreign Key column. This is the Foreign Key to the coverage entity. In this case, Personal AutoCov. It also has a Foreign Key to the coverable personal vehicle. Because the line coverage for personal auto is rated per vehicle even though the coverable vehicle is not on the line. Next, let's look at the Personal Vehicle Cove Cost entity. This is the cost for the personal vehicle coverages. Click the Foreign Key. This is the Foreign Key from the cost entity to the coverage entity. Next, let's look at a cost for the business owner's line. This is the cost for building coverages. There are cost entities for non-coverage objects that bear costs on the policy. Such as additional insured on the business owner's and general liability lines. This is the business owner's additional insured cost entity. Notice that it has a Foreign Key to the additional insured entity, rather than to a coverage. Next, we'll create a new cost entity. Expand Extensions. Right-click Entity. Click New Entity. This is the new entity screen. Enter the entity name. Notice that the table name is set automatically based on the entity name. Click the Entity Type drop-down. Select Subtype. Enter a description. Click the SuperType Lookup button. This is the SuperType Lookup screen. Type PA and then select PA Cost. Click OK. Click OK. The new entity has been created, but there is an error in the code generation window. Click Save to trigger code generation. Now the error is resolved. Click the button. Select Implements entity. Set the name property to cost. Click the button again. Select Implements interface. Set the interface property to cost adapter. Set the implementation property to PA Cost Adapter. Set the implementation property to PA Cost Methods Imple. Select Implements interface. Set the interface property to PA Cost Methods. Set the implementation property to PA Cost Methods Imple. Click Save to validate the changes. This concludes the demonstration.",
