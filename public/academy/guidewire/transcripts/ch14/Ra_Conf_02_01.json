  "full_text": "The AbstractCostDatabase class provides common financial properties matching the cost delegate. In addition, it provides common methods to be used by the rating engine. There are abstract properties and methods that the subclass must implement accurately. Next, we'll look at a few of the common methods. This class is several hundred lines long, so we'll use the Find feature in Studio to locate the methods we are interested in viewing. Click the Edit menu. Click Find. The first method we are interested in viewing is the MergeIfCostEqual method. Enter the method name into the Find field. This first matches in a code comment, so click the down arrow to find additional matches. To merge two rate scalable cost date and objects together, use the MergeIfCostEqual method. If two cost date and objects are adjacent in effective time and equal, then this method sets the expiration of the earlier cost to the expiration date of the later cost. The color discards the location. The later cost. Costs are equal if the isCostEqual method returns true. It checks that the two costs have the same basis, rates, and term amounts, along with a few other things. Next, let's look at the CopyStandardColumns to ActualColumns method. Enter the first part of the method name into the Find field. Here is the CopyStandardColumns to ActualColumns method. The method copies the standard columns into the actual columns. Next, let's look at the KeyValues property. Enter KeyValues into the Find field and then click the down arrow to find the property. Here is the abstract property for KeyValues. These values are used to determine if this cost data is the same as another cost data. If two cost data objects have the same keys they are considered to be equal and may potentially be merged. Next, we'll look at the set specific fields on cost methods. Here is the set specific fields on cost method. After a line of business creates its cost data objects, the default rating engine creates new cost entities or updates existing cost entities. The root cost data class knows how to copy all the built-in cost properties from the cost data object to the cost object. However, for a cost data subclass, the default rating engine needs help to copy any subclass specific properties to the corresponding new or changed cost entity. To coordinate this with the default rating engine, each cost data subclass must override, implement, the method set specific fields on cost. Next, let's look at the GetVersionCosts method. Here's the GetVersionCosts method. Probably the most complicated method to implement on cost data objects is the GetVersionCosts method. Refer to the Policy Center documentation for more information on implementing this method. For every cost subtype entity, there must be a defined cost data subclass. Let's look at a couple of examples. Press Ctrl-N to search for a class. Search for the Personal Autocove Cost Data class. Double-click the class to open it. Here is the Personal Autocove Cost Data. Next, let's open the corresponding cost entity. Press Ctrl-N. Search for Personal Autocove Cost. Double-click the Personal Autocove Cost entity. Here is the entity. The Cost Data subclass must contain the member variables that match the columns in the corresponding cost subtype entity. Use the key object type and cost data for the four and key columns in the cost entity. Key object stores the fixed ID of the other object. It is also used to set the specific field on cost. Notice that the Vehicle ID is set to the fixed ID of the associated vehicle and the Cove ID is set to the fixed ID of the associated coverage. Next, let's look at the PA Rating Engine class. Search for the class. Open the class. Here is the Rating Engine class for the Personal Autoline. Here is where the cost data and object is created during rating. The Abstract Rating Engine merges cost data and objects for similar costs. Each cost data subclass must implement the Key Values property to help the rating engine to determine whether two cost data and objects are the same costs for the same things. Let's return to the Personal Autocost data. Here is how the Key Values property is implemented for this cost data. The Vehicle ID and Cove ID are returned. This means that if two cost data and objects are for the same vehicle and coverage then they are considered to be equal and they will possibly be merged. Cost data base class takes care of setting general cost data properties, but subclasses must implement the Set Specific Fields on Cost function to set the fields specific to the associated cost. For example, foreign keys. Here is the implementation of the method for the Personal Autocov Cost data class. Notice that the superclass handles setting the general properties, however the foreign keys to the coverage and the vehicle are handled here. Cost data subclasses must implement the GetVersionCosts function in order to find the candidate set of costs to potentially reuse, or clone, when persisting this cost data as a cost. Here is the implementation of the GetVersionCosts method for this cost data. Let's look at another example of this method. Press CTRL-N. Search for classes starting with PA Multi. Double-click the PA Multiple Policy Discount Cost data class. Here is the implementation for this cost data class. This concludes the demonstration.",
