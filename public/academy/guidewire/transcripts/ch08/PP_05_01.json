Each policy job has a selected policy period associated with it. The F dated entities in the policy period keep their state over the effective time of a policy. Start a new policy change. The policy change is effective on March 1, which is after the policy term start date. Change some values on the policy. For example, go to Vehicles. Change the car's color from red to blue. Quote the policy. Issue policy. Click OK. Click OK. Go back to the policy. Click Actions. Start a second policy change. Set the effective date to be after the previous job, for example, May 1.

When you request objects on the policy in slice mode, Policy Center automatically gets the correct version of each object as of the slice date. In the date field, select a date, February 1st, which is before the effective date of the first policy change. Go to Vehicles. The car's color is red on February 1st. Select a date, March 15th, which is after the first policy change and before the second policy change. A quick tip is to click somewhere outside of the date field to refresh the policy data. Go to Vehicles. The color is blue on March 15th. Select a date, May 30th, which is after the second policy change. Click somewhere outside of the date field to refresh the policy data. Go to Vehicles. The color is yellow on May 30th. The policy contract shows different data values on different date, because it retrieves the data in slice mode.
