  "full_text": "After reviewing the base UI layout, an insurance company wants to implement a few minor changes on the Details screen's Person Info tab. The details are shown here. In this demo, we are going to open an existing PCF, change the order of the widgets, and add a new input divider. Log in to training app as Alice Applegate. Use the username AApplegate and password GW. We'll navigate to a contact, William Andy. Click Search. In the Company slash Last Name field, enter Andy. Drill down on the William Andy entry in the search results. We need to look at the Details screen. Click Details. We can see a list of everything on the page by typing Alt plus Shift plus W, for widgets. Navigate to the new tab that opens. Expand the page structure entry. This is the widget inspector. It shows all the PCFs and their internal widgets referenced in the active application browser window, except for any workspace area. It also displays all the variables used to display this browser page. Close the tab. By typing Alt plus Shift plus I, for info, I can see a more focused view of the general file structure. This allows me to easily see how the PCF is put together. These combinations only work if the application has internal tools enabled, a simple flag in the configuration file that enables these and many other developer tools. If I want to edit the screen I'm looking at, I can type Alt plus Shift plus E, for edit. This key combination opens the main PCF for the screen in Studio. Here we can see that the widgets are color coded. Widgets shown in gray are defined directly in this PCF. Widgets shown in light blue are defined in a PCF reference by this PCF. Widgets shown in darker blue are referenced indirectly, through another PCF. For example, this main light area is a detail view with lots of widgets in it. But this darker area for license info is actually referenced by the detail view. This shows a hierarchical view of the main files constituting the screen. The page location is the main element and contains the screen. The screen is the top level container. It groups all the other containers. In this case, it contains a card view. Note, you can click on the individual cards in the card view and see the different containers it groups. The card view is a secondary container that groups primary containers, in this case, detail views. We can see some of these containers, but not all of them, in the structure tab. The reason we cannot see them all is because some of them are referenced by other containers. The detail view on the person info card is the one we need. We can open the detail view simply by double clicking it. The screen is the one we need. According to the wireframe, the date of birth widget needs to be below the marital status widget. We can move it by clicking and holding it and dragging it into place. Studio makes it easier to know where I'm putting the widget by showing these green lines. These are places where I can drop the widget into place. The lighter green line is where it will be placed if I release the mouse button. We also need a horizontal line between tax filing status and gender. These lines are called dividers. We can search for them in the toolbox. There are four divider types. Start a search for divider widgets by typing div into the text box. The one we want is the input divider. Click it, and the cursor changes, as before the green lines appear. Put the divider between tax filing status and gender. Place the mouse over the location where we want the divider, and left click. Save your changes by going to the file menu and clicking save all. Alternatively, you can use Ctrl plus S with your keyboard. Return to training app and we can load the changes to the PCFs using one more key combination, Alt plus Shift plus L, for load. If we return to the details screen, the changes can be seen in the user interface, as expected.
