  "full_text": "Business analysts have decided that the invoicing method for each policy must be stored in TrainingApp. The invoicing method specifies how the premium will be collected for the policy. At this time, the insurance company allows these three invoicing methods. The first is a 10% down payment and 11 installments. Second, is a 30% down payment and 4 installments. Third, is a 50% down payment and 2 installments. Business analysts are still working on the UI requirements, so we need only configure the data model at this time. We will create a new typelist, and then add a typekey field to the existing policy underscore ext entity, to refer to the typelist. As configuration developers, we need the ability to create and modify fixed lists of values to provide and restrict user choices in the UI. Thus, we need to know how to work with typelists in Studio, so we need to know how to work with typelists in Studio. So we can effectively create and modify typelists to implement user stories. First, we will explore where the main typelist resources are located in Studio's project view. The base application typelists are in the metadata slash typelist folder. To navigate to the base application typelists, click metadata. Then click typelist. This folder contains two read-only file types. TTI files are base application typelist statements. TTI files are in the extensions slash typelist folder. Click on extensions. Click on type list. This folder contains two editable file types. These are examples of TTI custom typelist definitions. These are examples of TTI custom typelist definitions. These are examples of TTI custom typelist extensions. If a custom typelist is defined in a TTI file, there is no need to create a TTI file for it, you can simply edit the TTI file as needed. TTI files are used to extend base application type lists. As you can see, the project structure, the resource names, and the naming conventions are very similar to those for entities. The only difference is that the extension begins with a T for type list, rather than an E for extension. Let's take a look at a typical TTI file. Double-click the bank account type dot TTI file. This is a custom type list, because it's in the extensions folder. And it can be modified or extended, because it is not final. Notice that the final property is false. The type list has three type codes, checking, savings, and other, behind-the-scenes, type list definitions, like entity definitions, are XML files. If we click in the text tab, we can see the XML file. Click the text tab. The structure is pretty simple. Each type code has its own listing, with a code, description, name, and priority. The type codes are all enclosed in the type list, which has a few properties of its own. Click the type list tab. Type lists are processed by the code generators in a similar way to the processing of entities. A Java class is generated from the TTI, TIX, and TTX files. Both incremental and bulk code generation are supported. Incremental code generation is triggered by validating or saving. Bulk code generation is triggered by rebuilding the project, including starting the server. Let's look at the generated Java code for the bank account type dot TTI file. Press CTRL plus shift plus N. Enter bank account type into the search field. Double click the bank account type dot Java file. This is the generated Java code for the bank account type type list. Notice the type codes for this type list. Click the scroll from source button to locate this code in the project view. Notice that the generated code location is configuration, generated, type key. Remember that there are four types of type list. Internal type lists are not extendable. Let's open the activity status type list to see this. Press CTRL plus shift plus N. Enter activity status in the search field. Double click on activity status dot TTI file. On activity status, the final property is set to true. Validation level is an extendable type list, meaning that it can be extended, either with a TIX file, or a TTX file. Let's open that type list. Press CTRL plus shift plus N to search for a file. Enter validation level in the search field. Double click the validation level dot TTI file. Its final property is false, but its platform property is true. Any TTI file you find or create in the metadata type lists folder is a custom type list. Let's look at a type list like this. Press CTRL plus shift plus N to search for a file. Enter contact destruction status in the search field. Double click on the type list. Its platform and final properties are both set to false. After reviewing the entity diagram and the requirement, we have identified two tasks. First, create a new type list and define its type codes. Second, add a new type key field to the policy underscore ext entity. First, we will create the new type list. Click on extensions. Right click on type list. In the new menu, select type list. Enter a name and description for this type list. Guidewire recommends that the type list name should be in Pascal case. Guidewire also recommends that custom type lists be created with a unique suffix like underscore ext to distinguish the type list from base application type lists. The description should contain information configuration developers need to know about this type list. Click OK to save the new type list. The only other property you might enter on the type list itself is the table name property. By default, the table name is xxtl underscore type list name, where xx is the application code. You can change this by setting table name, though the xxtl underscore prefix will still be added. Now we will add the required type codes. Click the green plus button to add a type code. Click the code property. Enter 30 down for insts in the code property. The code is an internal reference, and must be unique within the type list. It should be no more than 50 characters. For extensions of base type lists, Guidewire recommends using underscore ext or some other unique prefix. Enter the name. The name property contains the full name of the type code, as it will appear in the UI. Enter the description. Any additional information needed by configuration developers should be placed in the description property. In practice, it is often identical with the name property. Enter the priority. The priority determines the order in which the type codes will appear in the UI. Guidewire recommends numbering type codes with an interval, such as 10, so additional type codes can be added seamlessly. Now I'll quickly add the other two type codes, incrementing the priority by 10. Here are the additional type codes. Incidentally, since type codes don't use display keys, how can we allow them to support multiple languages? By using the localization button at the bottom right-hand corner of the type list. Click a type code. Click the localization button. The localization pane allows us to enter the name and description for each language implemented in the current configuration. Note, only the name and description fields need to be localized. Now, let's validate the type list we've created, and run the code generator. Remember that I can do this by saving or by clicking the validate button. Click the validate button. Now we can look at the generated Java class. Press Ctrl plus Shift plus N to search for a file. Enter invoicing method in the search field. Double-click the invoicing method.java class. Note, three type codes are present as final type keys. The type list class implements the type key interface. Let's add a new type key field to the policy underscore ext entity. Press Ctrl plus Shift plus N and search for a policy. Double-click the policy underscore ext entity. Click the down arrow. Select type key from the menu. Because this is a custom entity, we don't need to add underscore ext to its properties. In the name field, enter invoicing method. We'll select the invoicing method type list. In the type list field, select invoicing method underscore ext. Because there are existing objects in the database, we have to make the null OK property optional or there will be errors when we restart the server. The other option would be to provide a default value. In the null OK field, select true. As the last step, we'll start the server to deploy the data module changes. Click debug server icon to start the server. This concludes the demonstration.",
