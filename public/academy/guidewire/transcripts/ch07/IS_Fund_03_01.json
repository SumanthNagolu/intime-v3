  "full_text": "An insurance company wants to implement a social media functionality to provide a more personalized experience to customers. Every customer has the option to accept or decline this service. If no response is received from the customer, the default value is false, declined. If they accept the service, then the insurance company will store additional information about each customer. This information also needs to be displayed in the UI, and training app users have to be able to update it easily as needed. This folder contains two types of read-only files, ETI files, which contain base application entity definitions, and EIX files, which contain internal entity extensions. Look for example, at address.eti. This is the definition of address that is used in all Guidewire Insurance Suite applications. But if you look at address.ia, you see that it has many more properties, including fields, than the .eti file. This is because it implements functionality specific to training gap. As mentioned, these files are read-only and cannot be modified by customers. Customer modifications exist in this folder. This folder contains editable files of two types. 1. ETI files, which contain custom entity definitions. 2. ETX files, which contain custom entity extensions. For example, AB Attorney is an entity unique to training app. It extends the AB person vendor entity with information exclusive to attorneys, like an attorney license number and a legal specialty. AB Contact has an ETX file, containing fields which are defined on the base application configuration, but which can be modified by the customer. You can tell the base fields, which are editable, because the ones that are not are grayed out, while the editable custom fields are in black. If the customer wants to extend AB Contact, they should use the existing abcontact.etx. You can't create a new ETX file, because one already exists. You must work within the existing ETX file. The easy way to find and navigate to a configuration file is by typing Ctrl plus Shift plus N. When the dialog appears, begin typing AB Contact. Note that we get a filtered list of a lot of files, which gets more focused as I type. When I finish typing AB Contact, I have not only the files related to the entity, but files related to things like AB Contact address. Notice that here in the base definition of the entity, there is a field called Tax ID. Let's return to abcontact.etx. However, in the custom extensions file, we have a column override of Tax ID, which allows us to change or add to the specifications of the field. In this case, we have added a column parameter, called Encryption, which allows TrainingApp to encrypt the Tax ID file for additional customer security. What does the application do with an entity definition? The application processes the definition and generates a Java class when the code generators run and upgrade the physical database when the application is started. This is the class generated for AB Contact. The properties defined in the entity files are present here, along with a variety of methods. As shown here, some of the properties from the ETIEIXETX files are present in the class.",
