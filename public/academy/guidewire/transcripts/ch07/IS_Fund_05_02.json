  "full_text": "Now we will create atomic widgets, bind some of those widgets to data model fields, so they can display data, and define user-friendly labels. First, let's delete the placeholder label. Right-click the label and select Delete. We'll add the widget to the input column. In the toolbox, search for Label. We'll add the widget to the input column. In the toolbox, click Label and drop it into the input column. The label doesn't have any required properties, but it is a good idea to configure the label property so it can display static text in the UI. We will have two labels that will display the same text. So, instead of hard-coding the same text twice, we will use display keys. This will improve the application's maintainability, because if the text needs to be changed, we only need to update it in one place. Reusability is just one benefit of display keys. Another is that they aid in the international language. The label is also known for the original authorization and localization of the application. Guidewire recommends that PCFs should not contain hard coded text. So, let's define a display key for the label. The recommended naming convention for customer display keys is to use a standard prefix such as ext. In the label property, enter displayKey.getX.lastSocialActivity. By placing the cursor in the red text and hitting Alt plus Return, or depending on your keyboard, Alt plus Enter, we can create the display key. Select Create Display Key. The application suggests text for all languages. Right now, we are concerned with English, so we will correct it. Correct the base, English, entry to read last social activity was at, 0. The syntax with the curly braces is used to define dynamic values and input parameters in the display key. Click OK. Now we see that Studio underlines the display key because we defined a parameter for it. To fix this, we need to pass in a second argument to the get function. This second argument should be the value of the last social activity underscore X field we defined in the database. Let's add the second argument to display the value for the database. Before the right parenthesis in the label field, add a nab contact dot last social activity underscore X. The field has to be referenced relative to the root object of the PCF. The root object is an input parameter that the container receives from its parent. It typically comes from the database and contains the information the container needs to display data. You can see the root object at the top of the PCF by hovering over it. To modify the value of a display key, hold down the control key and click on it. You will be presented with a list of the languages for which the display key is available. Control click the X dot last social activity display key and select English, the first item in the list. This is the display dot properties file, where you can modify any of the many labels in an insurance suite application. Reminder, how can you best deploy these UI changes without restarting the server? Use control plus S to save and alt plus shift plus L in the browser to reload PCFs and display keys. Close the file. To match the layout in the wireframe, we'll add two horizontal lines. In the toolbox, search for input div and drag two input dividers beneath the label. We'll duplicate the label. Right-click the label and select Duplicate. Click Duplicate. Select the bottom label. Place the duplicate label below the two input dividers. Let's add the other fields. We'll add friendbook URL first. For that, we should use a text input widget. In the toolbox, search for a text input by typing text. Select the widget and place it between the two input dividers. The ID is a unique identifier of the widget in the current PCF. It cannot contain spaces or special characters. In the ID field, enter friendbook. The value specifies the data to be displayed. This is typically bound to the root object using the .operator. In the value property, enter an abcontact.friendbook underscore ext using the autocomplete functionality. The editable property is a Boolean expression, whose true slash false value specifies whether the widget value can be changed or not. Note that by Boolean expression we mean any GOSU expression that evaluates to true or false, including the hard-coded values true and false. In the editable property, type or select true. The label property is the user-friendly text that appears before the widget value. Use a display key to specify it. In the label property, enter display key.get x.friendbook. Use the auto-complete functionality to assist you. Finish the statement by typing, x.friendbook. Use the Alt plus Enter key combination to set the display key's value to friendbook URL. Click Create display key. Set the display key's value to friendbook URL. Click OK. If we scroll down we can see that the ValueType property is automatically set to java.lang.string. The ValueType property specifies the data type of the value. The text input widget is used for displaying a number of data types. So depending on the data type you use, you will have to specify the associated GOSU data type in the ValueType property. We can save some time by duplicating the friendbook widget and changing the copy to be the chirp widget. Right-click the friendbook widget. Click Duplicate. Set the ID property to chirp. Set the value property to anabcontact.chirp underscore extension. Change the display key from x.friendbook to x.chirp. Use the Alt plus Enter key combo to set its value to chirp URL. Change the value to chirp URL. Click OK. The required property defaults to false. It is separate from the null OK property on the entity and is relevant to the PCF, not the entity. If null lock is false or required is true, you cannot update an object where the field is null. The effect of this is that, using the PCF, you can require users to enter a value for a field that is not required in the entity. This can be useful sometimes. The correct widget type for the enrolled in social media field is a Boolean radio button. Search for that widget type. Insert the radio button between the first input divider and the friendbook widget. Set the ID property to enrolled in social media. Enter anabcontact.enrolledinsocialmedia underscore ext for the value property. For the label field, type display key dot get and set the value of the display key using Alt plus Enter. Use the autocomplete functionality. Edit the value to be enrolled in social media. Click OK. The value type property should be set to java.lang.boolean. Now let's set up the average social activity field. We'll use a text input widget for this dot in the toolbox search box, type text. Place a text input widget below the chirp widget. Select the newly placed widget. Set the ID property to average social activity. In the label property, enter display key dot get ext underscore average social activity. Use Alt plus Enter to set the display key value. Edit the English value to be average social activity, post slash month. Click OK. Enter anabcontact.averageactivity underscore ext for the value. Notice the value shows an error. It's underlined in red. Let's correct it dot scroll down to the value type. There is a type mismatch between the widget, java.lang.string, and the field, java.math.big decimal. Change the value of value type to java.math.big decimal. Finally, let's set up the last social activity field dot search for a date input widget by typing dat. Place a date input widget below the average social activity widget. Select the newly placed date input widget. In the ID property, enter last social activity. For the value of field, enter anabcontact dot last social activity underscore extension. In the label field, enter display key dot get ext dot last social activity label. Use alt plus enter to set the display key value to last social activity. Set the display key value to last social activity. Click OK. The date format and time format field set the display format for date and time, respectively. Set the date format field to medium. Set the time format to short. Scroll down to the value type. Notice the value type is java.util.date. Ensure all the fields we created are set to editable as true. The editable property should be set to true for all of the widgets between the input dividers. Check each widget and set the editable property to true as necessary. Run the server and log in to training app as obligate slash GW. Locate the William Andy contact. Click the Social Media tab. Click Edit. Enter some test data. Click Update. Click Update. Notice the change in value in the label that indicates when the last social activity occurred. Click Update. Click Update.             Click Update.   Click Update. Click Update.                                                     ",
