  "full_text": "Currently, users can add, remove, and edit policy details in the Policy ListView panel. However, the editable ListView panel on the page only exposes some of the policy entity fields. In this demonstration, we'll configure a popup that will allow users to view and edit all the fields of a policy. The policy should open when the user clicks the policy number in the ListView. First we will create a popup. Where should we put the popup? In the Policies underscore EXT folder we created in the first demonstration. Click Page Configuration. Click PCF. Click Training. Click AB Contact. Click Policies underscore EXT. Now we'll create the popup. Right-click the Policies underscore EXT folder. Select PCF file in the new menu. Select popup. Remember to select the right file type, because it cannot be changed later. In the file name field, enter policy underscore EXT. Click the OK button. Next, we will specify the entry point. What is an entry point? An entry point is a reference used by widgets to navigate to a given location. An entry point specifies the location name and the parameters required to render the location. Each location must have at least one entry point. Click the popup widget to view the properties. Click the entry point. Click the entry point. Click the entry point. Click the green plus sign. Click theountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountount property, enter true. The title property is required. Add a display key. There's one more property we want to set. This one will let users edit the pop-up contents as soon as the pop-up opens. Scroll down and select the start and edit mode property and select true. The pop-up is still red, because it needs a screen inside it. Now, we'll add some data to the pop-up, starting with the policy number. Remember that is a string, so we'll use a text input. In the toolbox, search for text input. Drag and drop one into the pop-up. The pop-up is no longer indicating an error because studio is smart enough to put the necessary containers around the text input. Notice that the input column, detail view, and screen have been added. Now we want the screen to be editable. Click the screen widget. In the editable property, select true. Click the detail view. In the editable property, select true. Now we'll configure the text input. We want it to be editable. Click the text input. In the editable property, select true. In the ID property, enter policy number. Set the label property using a display key. Set the value property. Next, we'll add fields for the premium. From the toolbox, drag and drop a monetary amount input widget below the policy number. Configure the monetary input. Next, we'll add the range input. The range input is a range and so it may be a little tricky. The value comes from the policy, but how shall we set the value range? From the toolbox, drag and drop a range input below the premium. Configure the range input as shown. Finally, we'll add the new property, the invoicing method. How should we implement it? From the toolbox, drag and drop a type key input below the location. Configure the type key input as shown. Now, let's configure the navigation. Where should we place the navigation? And how shall we implement it? In the action property of the policy number cell, on policy summaries underscore extlv. We will use the popups push function which is provided automatically for every popup we create. Click the policies underscore ext folder. Double click the PCF. What should we use as the argument for the push function? Use the row iterators element, current policy. Click the policy number text cell. Set the action property. To validate these changes in studio, let's save. Remember, when the PCF changes are validated slash saved, the studio also generates other classes and resources using internal code generators. PCF files support both incremental and bulk code generation. If we validate slash save, studio uses incremental code generation. When does studio use bulk code generation for PCF files? During project rebuild. Click code gen. The code gen window shows no validation errors, so let's deploy the changes. Do we need to restart the server? No, because we have only changed PCF files. Switch to training app. Reload PCF files by pressing Alt plus Shift plus L. Navigate to the summary page of the WilliamAndy contact record. Click the field. Type Andy. Click search. Click WilliamAndy.

There's only one problem. How can we save our changes? Click Return to Summary. This message appears, pointing out that the results haven't been saved. We have no update button. Click OK. So let's add an update button to the pop-up. Switch to Studio. Click the pop-up. In the Toolbox, search for the button. There is no individual update button. So we'll add a set of edit buttons. Drag an Edit Buttons widget to the top of the screen in the pop-up. Now we'll deploy. Save the changes. Switch to Training App. Reload the PCFs. Now we'll open the pop-up again. Click a policy number. Assign the policy and invoicing method. Now, click the Update button. We automatically return to the Summary page, where we can't see whether our work was saved. Click the policy number again. The invoicing method remains in place. Click Cancel. We have received one more user story about the policy pop-up. We need to restrict access to high-value policy details. If the policy premium is over $5,000, then only super user can view the policy details. If it is less than or equal to $5,000, any authenticated user can open the pop-up to view the details. How can we best implement this requirement? By using the CanVisit property. We need to set the CanVisit property so that it allows the user to visit if one of two things is true. Either, the user is logged in as super user or the policy's premium is no more than $5,000. Set the CanVisit property as shown. Save the changes. Reload the PCFs. To test this, we'll begin by logging in as super user. Search for contacts with the last name of Andy. Click on Eric Andy link. Let's give Eric two policies. Click Edit. Click Add. The first policy will have a premium of $3,000. Click Add again. The second policy will have a premium of $6,000. Click Update. Because I'm logged in as super user, I can open the pop-ups for both policies. Click the first policy. Click Cancel. Click the second policy. Click Cancel. Click the second policy.  Log in, as someone else. Click the gear icon. Click logout super user. Log in as Alice Applegate. Search for contacts with last name of Andy. Click Eric Andy. Click the policy number for the second policy. Notice that the pop-up doesn't open for the second policy. This is because it is not hyperlinked. Click the first policy. The policy opens as expected. Click Cancel. This concludes the demonstration.",
