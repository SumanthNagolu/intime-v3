  "full_text": "We have just received the following bug report from the testers. On the addresses screen, if I click the delete secondary addresses button, the application removes all the addresses, not only the secondary addresses, but the primary one also. Please fix ASAP. Hi first, we are going to reproduce the issue. Then, we will debug the code to identify the bug. Finally, we will implement and deploy the fix. To reproduce the issue, after logging into training app as Alice Applegate, navigate to a contact with multiple addresses. We'll navigate to the William Andy contact record. From the sidebar, select addresses. Note that one address, home, is selected as the primary address. Let's test the behavior. Click edit. Click delete secondary addresses. All addresses have been deleted. This is not the desired behavior. We'll cancel the deletion so we can continue to use this record for testing. Click cancel. Press ALT plus SHIFT plus E to navigate to the PCF in studio and investigate. The delete secondary addresses button is on a toolbar which is shaded blue. Why? The toolbar is in a referenced PCF. To open it we can double click the PCF in the canvas. Double click the delete secondary addresses button. The AB contact addresses. The AB contact addresses.ldv.pcf file opens with the focus on the delete secondary addresses toolbar button widget. The property we want to investigate is the action property. We can see that the button calls a method, delete AB contact secondary addresses. We can navigate to the function definition by control clicking it. Control plus left click the action property definition. We can see that this is a GOSU method of the PCF file itself, defined on its code tab. This is called a PCF method. GOSU functions are the same regardless of where you define them. However, the semantics are slightly different on a PCF method. The method is local to the PCF file that defines it. Not even referenced files can access it. It cannot be debugged at the place of definition. You have to open the generated PCF file name expressions.g's file after code generation, locate the method, and put a breakpoint there. It is called from a widget property such as action, value, available, editable, and so on. It has direct object to the root objects of the PCF file. The reason we would rewrite code on a PCF file as opposed to an enhancement or a GOSU class is because the logic the function implements is tied to one, or more, widget in that PCF file, and is not needed anywhere else. For example, determining the label for a button based on circumstances. Determining whether a text input widget is editable. Executing some initialization logic after navigating to a location. No special syntax is needed to call a PCF function, just the function name and its arguments. Notice that we can't set a breakpoint here in the PCF file. Click in the gutter beside the deleteABContactSecondaryAddresses function to test this. The function is not actually executed from the PCF file, but from a generated .gs code file. To find it we search for the file name, plus the word expressions. Search for and navigate to abcontactaddressesldvexpressions.gs using ctrl plus n. Type abcontactaddressesldve. Note that this is a read-only file. Nonetheless, we can set a breakpoint here. Scan down to find the deleted contact secondary addresses method, about line 69. Set a breakpoint on the remove address function. A breakpoint appears on the line we selected. Run the application server in debug mode and then click delete secondary addresses. The application turns a light color when the breakpoint is hit. Switch to Studio. The debug toolbar has buttons to perform the following actions. Among these, restart the debug process, resume execution, pause execution, stop the debug process, view breakpoints, mute breakpoints. The stepping toolbar has buttons to step over, into, and out of code. The frames pane shows a list of the threads of the application. You can export this to a text file, and customize frame presentation. For each thread, you can examine the stack frame, examine frames, navigate between frames, and automatically jump to a frame's source code in the editor. You can select a thread via the thread selector drop-down list at the top of the pane. The status and type of a thread are indicated by a special icon and a textual note beside the thread's name. The variables pane is shown here. This is the thread we're interested in, the one for the deleted contact secondary addresses function. In the variables pane, we can see the two variables relevant to the function, this and current address. Expand current address. With current address expanded, we can see all its properties. There are a couple of properties of interest, notably, display name and primary. To make them both easy to view we will add them to the watch list. Right click display name. Click add to watches. Right click primary. Click add to watches. Collapse current address. If it's not open, display the watch pane. In the watches pane, we can evaluate any number of variables or expressions, in the context of the current stack frame. These values are updated with each step through the application, and become visible every time the application is suspended by a break point. If an expression cannot be evaluated, it is displayed with a question mark. Note that the current address display name is 345 furlane, and primary is currently true. Click the resume program button. Notice the values change. This address is not primary. Clicking the resume program button again. Now it shows the third address, which is also not primary. Remember, there can only be one primary address. If we click resume program one more time, the program will continue, and the information in the panes vanishes. This is being because the values can only be shown when the application is suspended by a break point. PCF files support both incremental or bulk code generation. Incremental code generation is triggered on save, and during project make. The expressions.gs file cannot be modified. Let's return to the code tab in the PCF file. To fix this bug, we will put the remove address function into an if statement, so that it will execute only if primary is false. Return to the code. Return to the PCF file. Click the abcontactaddress.pcf tab. On the code tab, select the all code for the deleted contact secondary addresses function. Paste in the revised code over the old code. Switch back to the expressions.gs file. Click the break point to remove it. Press CTRL plus S to save changes. During save, we can watch studio generating the resources, though it takes less than a break point. Then, switch to training app. Let's test the revised code to see if we have fixed the bug. Use ALT plus SHIFT plus L to reload the changes to the PCF. Once the PCFs have been reloaded, click addresses. Click edit. Click delete secondary addresses. Notice the primary address has not been removed. Our bug has been fixed. Now we'll cancel, because we don't need to save the contact without the addresses. Click cancel. so",
