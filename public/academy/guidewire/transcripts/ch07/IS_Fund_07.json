  "full_text": "In the base configuration, a contact can have a training app user assigned to them. This user is responsible for maintaining the contact's information and resolving any flag entries raised during the lifetime of the contact. The user appears on the Contact Summary screen as shown here. The insurance company's business analysts want to make the assigned user field on this screen navigable, so that when a user with the appropriate permissions, such as SuperUser or the administrator, logs in and clicks on the user name, it can be obtained from the user to make the user field. The system opens a pop-up, and the super user or admin can easily see the user details and, if necessary, make changes. During the initial analysis, the business analyst determined that the pop-up already exists, and is named user detail pop-up.pcf. In this demonstration we are not going to worry about permission control, because it is already implemented on the pop-up. The only thing we have to do is write the code to open the pop-up. We'll begin by looking at the destination PCF in studio. In studio, search, control plus shift plus N, for user detail pop-up.pcf. Start typing user detail pop. Select user detail pop.pcf. This is a pop-up location, containing a single reference screen as the top-level container. The screen contains all the additional PCF elements and widgets. Click the pop-up to select it. Locations are fundamentally different from containers. The purpose of a container is to group displayable UI elements and display them. The purpose of a location is to define navigation. Click the Entry Points tab. Locations don't have required variables to define input parameters. Instead, they have entry points, technically, the signature of the location. The entry point defines the input parameters the location needs. Every location must have at least one entry point. However, a location can have more than one entry point depending on how it is used. For example, suppose a pop-up can be used to either modify or create an account. The layout is the same in both cases. The only difference is that data already exists in the first case, but not in the second case. You can use the same pop-up by defining two entry points. One with a parameter that references the account to be displayed, and one with no parameter, which tells the pop-up to create and initialize the account. In the left-hand panel of the Entry Points Editor, select User Detail Pop-up User User. Next, we have to locate the source widget, the widget that will navigate to this pop-up. We know from past experience that we need the A-B Contact Summary Page. Search, Ctrl-Shift-N, for A-B Contact Summary Page.pcf. Type a B Contact Summary Page. Double-click A-B Contact Summary Page.pcf. Looking at this, we see that the Assigned User widget is shaded dark blue, so I double-click it, opening A-B Contact Summary.pcf. Double-click Assigned User. The widget is a range input. Looking at its advanced properties, we see the action property. This property can be set to a GOSA statement. If it is set, the atomic widget becomes clickable. Clicking on it executes the GOSA statement. The basic code for navigation is pretty simple. You enter the name of the entry point, a method, and any parameters the entry point requires. In this case, the location entry point is User Detail Pop-up. Click the action field to select it. There are three methods available. Go navigates to the location, replacing the current contents of the frame. Go in Workspace opens the location in the workspace frame, at the bottom of the screen. Push opens the location in the current frame, but retains the current location so that it can be returned to. Since this is a pop-up location, we will use the push method to navigate. In the action property, type User Detail Pop-up.push. Finally we need a parameter. The entry point for User Detail Pop-up requires a user, but the only variable defined on AB Contact Summary is a NAB Contact. Fortunately, we know that this very field, Assigned User, displays a user. So we can copy the value property and plug it into the method. Select the contents of the value star property, right-click, and select Copy. Place the cursor between the parentheses of the push method, right-click, and select Paste. Now we'll deploy the changes by saving. Type Control plus S and then switch to Training App. First, reload the PCFs. We'll log in as Super User so we have access to the pop-up. Log in as SU slash GW. Navigate to the WilliamAndy Contact. Click Update. There is no value in the Assigned User widget, so we let it in Assign 1. Click Edit. In the Assigned User dropdown, select Alice Sabblegate. Click Update. Click Alice Sabblegate. When we click on the name, the user summary appears. We could edit it. Click Return to Summary. What if there is no assigned user? Click Edit. In the Assigned User drop-down, select None. Click Update. The application displays nothing in the field, so there is nothing to click on.",
