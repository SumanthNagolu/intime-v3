  "full_text": "The business analysts have determined that every new doctor contact with one or more flag entries should be assigned to the creator, the logged-in user, for further processing. In addition, a note explaining that the contact has been automatically assigned should be associated with the contact. Before beginning this demo, we'll create two display keys, 1, x.contact assigned equals contact automatically assigned 2, x.new contact with flag entries auto assigned equals new contact. The new contact has been automatically assigned to 0, because it has 1, flag entries. Expand the config folder. Expand localizations. Expand resource bundle display. Double-click display.properties. After the x.chirp display key, press return. We'll paste in the code for the new display keys. The code for the new display keys appears. There are already two places in the UI to create a contact in training app, and, since the application is fully configurable, additional contact creation methods could be introduced in the future. For example, contact information could be imported from an external system via an integration point. So, what's the best strategy to implement this requirement? Remember that GOSA rules will be executed when an event happens to an entity. The great thing about GOSA rules is that, is that they don't care what the source of an event is, whether it's from the UI or an integration point. As long as an event happens, we can be sure that the same set of rules will be executed, regardless of the source. That is why a Goza rule is the perfect tool to implement this requirement. A rule set is a collection of rules that have the same root entity type. Rules are organized into hierarchies. Also recall a rule set category is a collection of rule sets that have two things in common. High-level business purpose, triggering event in our business case. The triggering event is the creating of the contact, saving it to the database for the first time. What is the business purpose in our business use case? To set the assigned user field, and end a contact note, technically, last-minute changes before committing the transaction. The rule set category we should use then is pre-update. Expand rule sets. Expand pre-update. As you can see there are four rule sets available in the pre-update rule set category. The type of entity that is triggering is A-B contact, so we'll create a new A-B contact pre-update rule. Double-click A-B contact pre-update to open it. As you can see from the first few rules, the insurance company uses the naming convention for rules. Since we are going to make a rule for new doctor contacts, we'll expand the first pre-update for A-B contact to see the rules within it. Right-click on the A-B contact rule. We'll create a new rule that is triggered when a new doctor contact is created. Click new rule. In the rule name field, we'll give it a unique name using the company's naming convention. We'll use AB for the application name abbreviation, PU for the rule set category abbreviation, and 5000 for the unique rule four-digit code. We'll then add a dash and a user-friendly description of the rule's purpose. Enter the following for the name of the rule, AB for 5000, automatic assignment of new flagged contacts. Click OK. However, if you need to move the rule to a different position, you can simply drag and drop it. We'll return the rule to its original position. The rule has two sections to configure, the condition, and the action. The condition is set to true initially. It has to be a GoSue expression that returns either true or false. The action will only be executed if the condition returns true, otherwise, nothing happens. Click true and change the value. Based on the business requirement, the condition is that the contact must be new, and it must have at least one flag entry. We can use the new property of the entity to test if the contact is new. Every entity has this property, which is only true if the entity is being created in the current transaction. It will be false in case of any subsequent modifications. Type AB contact.new. Press Return. Flag entries is a data model array on the contact, defined in the abcontact.age file. Recall that arrays have a length property that we can use to test how many entities are in the array. Type. And. A bcontact.flag entries.length. equals 0. In the action section, we have to complete two different things. 1. Set the current user as the assigned user of the contact to. Create a new node and associate it with the contact. Recall from the introduction to locations lesson that the contact has the assigned user field. We can use the get current user function to get the currently logged in user. Type. App contract.assign user equals user.util.get current user. Recall from the introduction to Goza lesson that we can create new objects using the new keyword, and then use the dot notation to initialize its fields. I will paste the next section of code in now. Now that we've created the note, we have to associate that with the contact. How would you add a new entity to a data model array? Every parent object has two functions to work with arrays, add to array name entity and remove from array name entity. Press Return to add code to a new line. Type a bcontact.add to contact notes note. Type a new command. We see here the completed Goza rule. You can deploy modified rules using run, reload changed classes. But this is a new rule, so we have to restart the server. Restart the server in debug mode. Click run. Click debug server. We see the server ready message. Login to training app as a apple gate slash gw. Click login. Click actions. Under new person, vendor, click doctor. Enter a first name. Enter a last name. Enter a social security number. Click update. Click update. Now we'll view the contact we just created. Click search. Search for the last name of the contact we created. Click search. Click the name of the contact we created. We see that it is indeed assigned to the user of the system. In this case, we logged in as Alice AppleGate. Let's look at the notes. In the sidebar, click notes. We see there was a note created. Click the subject of the note. We can see the values in the note are set according to the new rule we created. Notice that we didn't do any database transaction management in the rules code. Rules have an implicit transaction that will be committed after the execution of the rules. Keep in mind that if your rule throws an exception, then all the changes done by the other rules will be rolled back too.",
