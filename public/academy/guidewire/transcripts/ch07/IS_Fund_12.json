  "full_text": "An insurance company wants to display policy summaries for contacts. Policy details are stored in the policy administration system, and the integration developers are currently implementing the integration point to retrieve the policy summaries. As configuration developers, we need to configure the data model in the user interface to meet the requirements. We are going to create a new entity called policy underscore ext. Recall that Guidewire recommends using underscore ext or some other unique suffix in the name of new entity. This avoids issues during upgrades to the next version. The entity will have two data fields, policy number, which is a VARCH R10, and premium, which is a monetary amount. Monetary amount is a different type of field from a column, and allows us to store both the amount and the currency type. We will also set up two relationships. First, a policy can have exactly one location associated with it. This is a foreign key relationship. Second, a Navy contact can have zero to many policies associated with any policies associated with it. This is an array relationship. Next, let's implement these changes. The first step is to create the entity. Remember, base application entities are stored in the metadata entity folder, while custom entities are stored in the extensions entity folder. Click extensions. Click Entity. Right-click Entity. Click Entity from the new menu. This is the new entity pop-up. Type policy underscore ext. The Entity type field specifies the kind of entity that will be created. Click the Entity type field to see the options. It can be a top-level entity. It can be a top-level entity, a subtype, a delegate, and so on. We are creating an entity in this lesson, but we will create a subtype in a later lesson. The product documentation describes the other options. Click Entity. The description field documents any information that configuration developers need to know. This information will be displayed in the data dictionary. Type representation of a policy. The table field specifies the name of the database table, which will be created for the use of this entity. The table name is automatically generated to match the entity name, but is all lowercase. The length of the name cannot exceed 25. If the entity name is longer than 25, the table name can be modified to meet the length requirement, including removing the underscore ext suffix if necessary. Naming collision is avoided by the prefix that is added to the application abbreviation. For example, ABX is the prefix that will be added to the table name. The type field specifies how the application will manage the entity. Click the type field to view the options. Retirable means that the entity can be not only logically but also physically deleted. Versionable means that the application will keep the history of the entity. See the product documentation for more details. For this entity, we want to use Retirable, so click that option. The extendable checkbox is for internal usage only, and is not relevant for custom entities. It determines whether an ETX file can be created for this entity. Custom entities cannot be extended, so it doesn't matter whether this checkbox is checked or not. If the exportable checkbox is checked, then the entity supports entity serialization, which is required for the deprecated RCPE web services and the SOAP API. If the final checkbox is checked, you cannot subtype the entity. It defaults to true, but we will uncheck it so that we can subtype the policy underscore ext entity. Click the final checkbox to uncheck it. Click the OK button to create the entity. Now we'll define the policy number. Click the button. Select column. Click the name property. The name is policy number. Note that because this is on a custom entity, we don't need the underscore ext suffix for the individual fields. Type policy number. Click the type field. Type varchar. Select varchar. Should the policy number field be nullable? No. In fact, none of the entity fields should ever be null. We need to set the null OK property to false. Click the null OK property. Click the down arrow. Select false. Do we need default values for these fields? No, because this is a new entity, so there is no danger of an existing record lacking the required fields. What additional information do we need for the policy number? Because it's a varchar field, it needs a size column parameter. Right-click policy number. Select column parameter. Select column parameter. Click the name property. Click the down arrow. Select size. Click the value property. Type 10. Next, we'll define the premium field. This is a special data field that stores both the amount and the currency, called monetary amount. Click the button. Select monetary amount. The monetary amount has two required properties, a name, and the null OK property. Click the name property. Type premium. Click the null OK property. Click the down arrow. Select false. Select false. Finally, we'll add a foreign key for the location. Finally, we'll add a foreign key for the location. Recall from the diagram that this is the policy location. Click the button. Select foreign key. Click the name property. Type policy location. What entity should the foreign key point to? The answer is address. Click the property. Type add. Select address. And what should we select for the null OK property? The null OK property should be false. Click the property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property. Click the column name property property. Type Policy Location ID. Now we need an array for abcontact to policy underscore ext. Let's search for the abcontact entity. Press Ctrl plus Shift plus N. Type, abcontact. What type of entity is abcontact? How do we know? It is a base application entity, because it is represented by an ETI file in the metadata entity folder. How can we add fields to base application entities? By extending them in an ETX file. Select abcontact.etx. Let's define the array. Click the button. Select Array. Type policies underscore ext. It is an array of policies. Type policy. Select policy underscore ext. In the description property type, all policies belonging to the contact. Now we need to go back to the policy entity and add a foreign key. Click the policy underscore ext. Entity tab. Click the button. Select foreign key. Type, owner. Click the foreign key entity property. Type abcon. Select abcontact. Select false for the null property property. Type contact ID for the column name property. Now, we can return to the abcontact entity to set the array field property. Click the abcontact tab. Type, owner. Let's validate and save the changes in studio. Now, there is an error, pointing out that an exportable array cannot use a non-exportable entity. Since we have no need to make policy underscore ext exportable, let's make the needed change on the array. Click the exportable property. Click the down arrow. Select false. Click save. There are no errors. Let's look at the generated code. Press control plus shift plus n. Type policy. Double click policy. Type policy. Double click policy. We can see that all the fields we have defined are here, along with several fields automatically generated by the application. Now, look at abcontact. Press control plus shift plus n. Type abcontact. Select abcontact.java. This is the generated code for abcontact. Let's scroll down to line 124. There is a new property for the array. In addition, there is a method for adding a policy, method for getting a policy, and a method for removing a policy. Now that the data entities are complete, I'll start the server. This also provides a final check that everything I've created has proper syntax and so on. Click run. Click debug server. The server has started successfully. This completes this demo. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run. Click run.
