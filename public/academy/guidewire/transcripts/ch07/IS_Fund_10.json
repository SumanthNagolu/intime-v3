  "full_text": "We have just received two new user stories from the business analysts of an insurance company. Both user stories deal with persons and their subtypes only. User Story number 1. For each person, if the age is known, we want to see how many years the person has remaining until retirement. The value should be calculated from the age, and be displayed as a read-only field in the UI, under the date of birth field on the person info card. If the person's age is not known, display unknown. User Story number 2. We also need a toolbar button on the person info card with the label, Suggest Insight Score. This button should be available only if the location is in edit mode, and the contact score field is null. When the user clicks the button, the following logic should execute. 1. If the Employment Info section is filled out completely, the score should be set to 10. 2. If the Employment Info and License Info sections are both filled out completely, the score should be set to 20. 3. Otherwise, nothing happens. First, we will create a new enhancement with a getter property and a function. Then, we will make the necessary user interface configurations. In Studio, the AB Person entity already has an enhancement called AB Person Enhancement in the Training App package. Navigate to Configuration, GSRC, Training App, Entity. Double-click to open AB Person Enhancement.gsx. We could modify the existing enhancement, or create a new one. For the sake of simplicity, the implementation team has decided to create a new insurance company-specific package. We will therefore create a new enhancement, and store it in that package. Recall that a package is a logical group of classes. It is also commonly referred to as a namespace. Right-click on the GSRC package. Click New. Click Package. Remember, all GOSA resources are created under the GSRC node in Studio. GSRC stands for GOSA Source. The recommended naming convention is to use .notation and specify the company name, the app code, and two further specifications delineating the functional area of the package. Enter succeed.ta.enhancements.entity for the name of the package. Click OK. Now we'll create the new enhancement. Right-click the new package. Click New. Click GOSU Enhancement. We search for the entity to enhance using the Search by Name tab. Start typing AB to find AB Person. Select AB Person. We'll give it a name beginning with the entity name and ending with the word enhancement, with a word or two of description between. In the name field, enter AB Person succeed enhancement. Click OK. We are going to create the Years Until Retirement as a virtual property using a getter. Getters have the following syntax requirements. The property Get keyword, the name in Pascal case, no parameters allowed, a return type, may not be void, a getter can have one, and only one, return statement for convenience, will have it return a string value. Inside the enhancement body type, property Get Years Until Retirement string. The easiest way to do this is to return a variable called result. We'll set it to unknown as the default in case the age is not known. Type var result equals unknown. The this keyword refers to the current object, and is used to access other physical and virtual members of the same entity. We'll use an if statement to change the value of result only if the value of this.age is known. Type if this.age. Looking at the source for this.age, you can see that it is a virtual property that returns either a string containing the age of the contact, or unknown. That's why we set the base value of result to unknown. We'll proceed if the user's age is instead known by using logic equivalent to if the age is not unknown. Type does not equal unknown. In the case of the age being known, we will then set the value of result to the difference between retirement age, which will rather arbitrarily set at 65, and their current age. And finally, we'll return the value of result. Type return result. The other requirement is to suggest an insight score. It needs to set a value, but doesn't need to return any value, so we'll implement it as a function. Functions have the following syntax requirements. The function keyword, the name in Pascal case, can have 0, 1, or many parameters declared. A return type, may be void. Type, functions suggest insight score, void. Once again, we can use the this keyword to find the values of properties of the current object. The employment info section has two fields, occupation and employer. If these are both filled in, we want to set score to 10. Type, if, this dot occupation. Equals null and this dot employer. Equals null. This dot score equals 10. Likewise, if the license section is completed, we want to raise the score to 20, but only if the employment section is also completed. We could use a separate if statement, but it is more efficient to nest it in the first if statement, so it will only be evaluated if the first condition is true. The license section has two fields, license number and license state. Type, if this dot license number. Equals null and this dot license state. Equals null. This dot score equals 20. The enhancement is now complete, and displays no syntax errors, so we'll save the work. Press control plus s. Because this is a new package, we can't just reload classes, we have to restart the server. Click run. If the server is running, click stop server, if available. Click run. Click debug server. Now, we'll take a look at the screen we need to modify to hold this information. Log into training app as aapplegate slash gw. Navigate to the details screen of the William Andy contact record. Type Andy for the last name. Click search. Click William Andy. Navigate to the details screen. The best way to open this page in studio is to press Alt plus Shift plus E. Recall that we wanted to put the years until retirement display immediately below the date of birth field. The date of birth field is in a light blue section. Double click it to open the appropriate detail view. Now we'll configure the years until retirement field. From the toolbox, search for the text input widget. Select the text input widget. Insert the text input widget below the date of birth input widget. In the ID star property, enter years until retirement. Note that the root variable of this detail view is an AB contact, but the years until retirement enhancement is on AB person. To use it in the value property, we have to cast an AB contact as AB person, but no special syntax is needed for the property get. We'll just use the usual dot notation to reference it. In the value property, enter. An AB contact is AB person. Years until retirement. I need a label for this field. I'll create a display key using Alt plus Enter. In the label property, enter, display key dot get X dot years until retirement. Place the cursor somewhere in years until retirement and press Alt plus Enter. Click Create display key. Add spaces to the text for readability. Enter years until retirement. Click OK. Notice that we cannot make this widget editable, because it is a virtual property. If we tried to make it editable, we would get a runtime error. The editable property here is, or should be, set to false. Now we'll create a toolbar button to access the Suggest Insight score function. It has to be on the page, not the detail view because the toolbar we need to use exists on the panel ref on the page, not in the detail view. We'll use the toolbar button widget. Navigate to AB person details page dot PCF. From the toolbox, select a toolbar button widget and insert it in the empty toolbar in the panel ref, not the toolbar at the top of the screen. The action of the toolbar button we added is to use the function we defined on the AB person enhancement. Again, we have to cast to AB person. In the action property, enter, an AB contact is AB person. Suggest Insight score. Of course, an ID is required. In the ID property, enter Suggest Insight score. For the label, define a display key called Suggest Insight score. Change the default value to Suggest Insight score. Click OK. Reload the PCFs, and then in the sidebar, select Details. The years until retirement is there, but empty, because the age is not set. The Suggest Insight score button is present, but the Insight score field is zero. If we click the Suggest Insight score button, it remains zero, because the employment and license fields are not fully filled out. Click the Suggest Insight score button. The Insight score remains zero, because the employment and license fields are not fully filled out. Let's edit William Andy and fix this. Click Edit. We'll set William Andy's birthday. In the date of birth field, enter a date about 55 years ago. Scroll the year to 1964. Select 1964. Select Today. Note that the years until retirement field now has a value. We'll give him a job. He's already got Albertsons as his employer. In the occupation field, enter Manager. If we click Suggest Insight score now, the Insight score field changes to 10, or a number close to 10, depending on the Birth Year entered. Click Update. If I click Suggest Insight score now, the Insight score field will change to 10, or a number close to 10, depending on the Birth Year entered. Click Suggest Insight score. The Insight Score field changes to 10, or a number close to 10, depending on the birth year entered. Now we'll add license information. Click Edit. Enter a plausible license number. Select a state. Click Update. The Insight Score is still 10, but if we click Suggest Insight Score we should see a changed value. Click Suggest Insight Score. The Insight Score changes to 20.",
