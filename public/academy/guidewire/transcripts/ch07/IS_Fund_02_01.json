  "full_text": "We are going to use the GWB Gradle command to generate the data dictionary. In Windows Explorer, Shift plus right click on c colon backslash g dot w. 10 backslash training app. Select open command window here from the context menu. A command window opens. You can also use the xcompile flag to tell Gradle not to rebuild the project before generating the dictionary, which cuts the time by about 75 to 80%. The data dictionary does not come pre-generated, so you should generate it immediately after installing any guidewire insurance suite application. You should also regenerate it anytime developers extend the data model. This validates the changes and refreshes the HTML pages of the data dictionary. When the process is complete, it shows the build successful message. Now we'll open the data dictionary. In Windows Explorer, navigate to c colon backslash gw10 backslash training app backslash build backslash dictionary backslash data and double click index dot HTML to open it. Notice that there are three entity views, plus a type lists view and an all fields view. The full data entities view shows both persistent and virtual entities. Virtual entities are not stored in the database but generated as needed. It includes, for each entity, the columns, type keys, arrays, associated for and keys, and subtypes. The database view shows only persistent entities that can be loaded from external sources. It includes the columns, type keys, and subtypes. The data base and migration views are for special purposes. Let's concentrate on the basic data entities view. Let's look at AB contact, the core entity of training app. The header of an entity contains the name of the entity and the name of the database table. It also lists implemented delegates. Delegates are special entities that cannot be instantiated. They are used to define fields and behaviors needed by multiple entities. The header also contains an expandable description of the entity and lists attributes of the entity. Attributes determine some of the behaviors of the entity. To find out what an attribute is, you can see. The object attribute means, click the question mark by its name. For example, the abstract attribute means that the entity cannot be instantiated directly, but only through one of its subtypes. There is an expandable list of foreign keys in the application that point to this entity. For example, the bank account and address entities have foreign keys pointing to AB contact. If an entity has subtypes, there is a subtype list next. The list identifies all the child subtypes of this entity. Their position in the hierarchy is indicated by indenting. The hierarchy builds down from the root. For example, AB law firm is a subtype of AB company vendor, which is a subtype of AB company, which is a subtype of AB contact. Now let's look at the heart of the data entity, its fields. The example we'll look at here is create time, which is a field of type date time. As the description shows, it stores a timestamp of the date and time when the object was created. We also see that it has the non-null attribute, which means that this is a required field. Attempting to save an AB contact without this field populated will result in an error. Fortunately, it is automatically populated when the object is created. Finally, there is an expandable list of places in the user interface where the field is displayed. Create user has some more interesting features. It is a foreign key, which means that it contains a pointer to some other object in the database, in this case, the user, user, who created the AB contact. Also, the database column, create user ID dash is displayed. Note, create time did not require a database column, because creation time is a standard property of all database tables in guide wire applications. Most fields have their names displayed in green. Some, like financial summary, are displayed in blue. This means that they are part of an extension to the entity. For core entities, this means that they can be modified or removed as long as this can be done without causing data problems. Vendor type is a special kind of field called a type key. This means that it refers to a defined list of values and points to one specific value in this list. In this case, it refers to a list of possible types of vendors, such as auto glass shops, doctors, attorneys, and so on. Primary phone value is a derived property, meaning that it is not stored on the database at all, but calculated at runtime. In this case, it looks at the primary phone type type key to determine which of the AB contacts, possibly several, phone numbers as the primary phone number, then returns the phone number of that type as a string. After the fields, the data dictionary shows the arrays associated with an entity. An array is used when more than one of another entity may be associated with this entity. A single AB contact may have many bank accounts, which are stored in the bank account entity. The array includes a link to the other entity, thus, the bank accounts array includes a link to the bank account entity. If an entity has subtypes, each subtype may have fields and arrays unique to that subtype. For example, AB attorney has fields that indicate the attorney's license number and legal specialty. Now let's look at type lists. I can click home to return to the main page of the data dictionary, and then click type lists to navigate to the type lists page. As mentioned, a type list is essentially a list of values that can be referenced by objects. Let's look at activity category. The activity category type list is used by activities to determine what kind of given activity is, for example, an approval activity or a warning. This is used by activity patterns, which store the code value, enabling them to retrieve the name or description for display. Activities can be final. Activity status has the final attribute, meaning that its existing values cannot be changed or deleted. It can, however, be extended, adding new values to the type list. Click home, then all fields. The all fields page is literally that, an alphabetic list of every field declared in the application. Below each field name is a list of the entities that field is declared on. This is useful when you are looking for a field, and you don't know which entity it is declared on. Note that not every instance of a given field name refers to the same value, or even the same value type. For example, the author of a document is not the same as the author of a note. The author of a note is a foreign key to a user, while the author of a document is a string, varchar, storing a name.",
