  "full_text": "Abcontact.etx is already open. So I will begin adding the necessary columns, starting with enrolled in Social Media. From the extension drop-down, select Column. The column's name property is in title case, with the first letter of each word capitalized. It cannot contain spaces or any other characters other than letters and numbers. Also, the column's name property is in title case, with the first letter of each word capitalized. It cannot contain spaces or any other characters other than letters and numbers. So, we'll add the underscore ext suffix. For the name property, enter enrolled in Social Media underscore ext. The type property tells the database what kind of data to store. In this case we want a simple true slash false value, so I will select the bit data type. For the type property, start typing B and select bit. This is a required field, so I will select false for the null ok property, to say that the field is not allowed to be null. Start typing F and select false. This creates a potential problem. What about records already in the database? They don't have any values for this field, but it's required. To avoid this clash, I assign a default value of false to the default property. Start typing F and select false. Next, we'll add the column for the contact's friendbook account. From the extension drop-down, select column param. We'll call it simply friendbook underscore ext. For the name property, enter friendbook underscore ext. The type of this is a string variable, which uses data type varchar. For the type property, select varchar. And this is not a required column. Start typing true. For the null ok property, select true. Varchar columns need to have their size defined. This is done in a column parameter, or column param, sub element. This parameter is required for all varchar columns. From the extension drop-down, select column param. A column parameter defines some special detail of the column, based on the column's type. It consists of a name value pair which places some restriction on the column. There are a number of possible parameters you can add to a varchar column. In this case, we are interested in the size parameter. For the name property, show the possible parameter types, then select size. 100 characters should be enough for a friendbook address. For the value parameter, enter 100. The next column contains the user's average social media activity over the past month. From the extension drop-down, select column. For the name property, enter average activity underscore ext. This is a number, and it might not be a round integer, so we'll use the decimal type. Start typing d. For the type property, select decimal. Start typing t. Start typing t. For the null ok property, select true. This is because it might not have a value if the user doesn't use social media. Decimal is the other type, besides varchar, that has required column parameters. It has two required parameters. Precision is the total number of digits the number can have, both before and after the decimal place. In this case, we want a maximum of four digits. From the extension drop-down, select column parum. Start typing p. For the name property, select precision. For the value property, enter 4. Scale is the number of digits after the decimal place. We only want one digit after the decimal place. We only want one digit after the decimal place. We only want one digit after the decimal place. With precision 4 and scale 1, the possible values of this column will range from 0.0 to 999.9. From the extension drop-down, select column parum. Start typing s. For the name property, select scale. For the value property, enter 1. Last Social Activity. Last Social Activity column will tell the user when the contact last used their social media accounts. From the extension drop-down, select column. For the name property, enter Last Social Activity underscore ext. This column will hold both the date and time of the activity. Start typing d. For the type property, select date time. And, again, there may be no activity, so the column is not required. For the null ok property, select true. Finally, we'll add the column for the contacts chirp account. This will be effectively identical to the friendbook column, of our char with 100 characters. So we'll simply copy the column. Right-click the friendbook underscore ext column and select duplicate. A duplicate of the column was added. Change the value of the name property to chirp underscore ext. All the properties, and even the column parameter, have been copied with it, so we only have to change the name. Now I'm done editing, so I want to check my work. I'll validate the changes by clicking the validate button. This opens the CodeGen window, where any errors will be displayed. The CodeGen window shows no errors. If we had been working on several objects in studio, ewe could validate them all by using the file save all function, or simply type in control plus s. Let's show what happens when an error is introduced. Remove the column parameter for the chirp underscore ext column. With the column parameter removed, click the validate button. Since we introduced an error, when we click the validate button, an error appears in the CodeGen window. Let's fix the error by adding the column parameter back in. Start typing s. Now, looking at the abcontact java class. We can see the columns we added are now present. Switch to Windows Explorer.
