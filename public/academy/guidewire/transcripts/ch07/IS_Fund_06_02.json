  "full_text": "In this demonstration, we are going to a. Create a reusable DetailView. b. Move the widgets from the Social Media Card to the DetailView. c. Define a root object for the DetailView. d. Reference the new DetailView from both the Social Media Screen and the Social Media Card. e. Add a Toolbar and Edit Buttons. In Studio, the PCFs are located in configuration.config.page.config.pcf. In Studio, navigate to Configuration.config.page.config.pcf. This node contains both PCF folders and PCFs. The folders contain PCFs and, often, more folders. PCF folders organize PCFs into logical groups. Consider organizing your PCFs based on business use case, functional area, or something similar. A PCF folder is not a namespace. This means that no two PCFs can have the same name, even if they are in separate folders. Let's create a PCF for the work we'll do in this course. Right-click on the PCF node. Select New. Select PCF Folder. Enter the name's Exceed Demo and click OK. Note that the folder name cannot contain spaces or special characters. Now we'll create the PCF. Right-click on the Succeed Demo node. Select New. Select PCF File. It is a good practice to select the PCF type first. This will be a DetailView. Be careful to select the right PCF type. It is impossible to change it, so the only thing you can do if you select the wrong type is to delete it and recreate the file. Select the file from scratch. In the file type list, select DetailView. Notice that the dialog automatically creates the DV suffix. These suffixes are required by training app. We will call the file Social Media. In the file name text box, enter Social Media. We do not need the Mode field here. It is a more advanced topic. Click OK. An error message in the CodeGen window appears. The DetailView appears in red. This is because a DetailView must contain at least one child object, either an input column or a table layout. We will move the input column from the Card View to this DetailView. Navigate to the AB Contact Summary QF Social Media card. Use CTRL plus N to locate that PCF. Click the Social Media tab. Click the Social Media tab. There is no ability to select multiple widgets at one time. So we will move the whole input column as one. Right-click on the input column. Click Cut. Switch to the Social Media tab. Switch to the Social Media tab. Right-click in the canvas, and select Paste. Why are the widgets red? Because they reference the in AB Contact Root object, which does not exist on this DetailView. What is the root object? The root object is an input parameter that the container receives from its parent. It typically comes from the database, and contains the information the container needs to display. The root object is displayed at the top of the PCF. Note that there is no root object displayed on this DetailView. There are two Variables tabs. The Variables tab allows you to define local variables in the PCF to store temporary values. For example, you might store the return value of a complex GOSA function call because the value will be needed multiple times in the PCF. That way the app doesn't have to process the GOSA multiple times. The Required Variables tab allows you to define input parameters, or root objects, for the PCF. The parent PCF, which will reference the file, will have to pass in arguments that are instances of the required variable type. Click the Required Variables tab. Let's define the root object for OutDetailView. Click the green plus sign to add a new required variable. The best practice is to name the variable by its type, preceded with an A or N prefix, such as an AB Contact, an address, a bank account, and so on. For the name property, enter an AB Contact. The type, of course, is AB Contact. For the type property, enter AB Contact. This will get the red out of the detail view. Since we added the required variable information, the widgets are no longer red. Next, we'll reference this detail view from the original social media card. Return to the AB Contact Summary social media card. We'll begin by deleting the inline detail view. Click the inline detail view. Press the delete key. We can't put the reference directly in the card. There is no property for that, so we will use a PanelRef widget. A PanelRef can reference and display detail views, list views, card views, and several other objects. In the tool box, search for PanelRef. Select the PanelRef widget and place it on the card. Select the default. An error appears as we are missing some required property values. To reference the detail view, we use the Def property of the PanelRef. The Def property does two things. First, it names, references, the PCF to display. In the Def property of the PanelRef, start typing SocialM and select SocialMediaAdVarg1.abContact. Select an AB Contact. Note that the detail view is currently red. This is because it needs its required variable, which is the second thing the Def property does. Select an AB Contact. Now we'll do the same thing on the Social Media page. Navigate to abcontactsocialmediapage.pcf. You can use Ctrl plus N to locate the file. Start typing abcontactsoci to locate the abcontactsocialmediapage.pcf. Navigate to abcontactsocialmediapage.pcf. We'll delete the inline PanelRef. Right-click the detail view and select Delete. We'll drag a PanelRef into the screen. In the tool box, search for PanelRef and then drag it onto the screen. We'll configure the PanelRef to reference the detail view. In the Def property, enter SocialMediaDB and AB Contact. We'll check our work at this point by saving it. Type Ctrl plus S to save your work. Now we'll switch to Training App. Click the Social Media tab. The Social Media card looks right. In the sidebar, select Social Media. There's only one thing missing, ability to edit the page. To do this, we'll have to add Edit buttons. Switch back to Studio. Edit buttons affect the whole location, no matter where they are placed. For example, if you have several detail views and PanelRefs on one screen, and you put Edit buttons on one of them, clicking Edit will put the whole screen in Edit mode. So we will put the Edit buttons on the screen, not the PanelRef. In the tool box, search for Edit buttons. Drag the Edit buttons to the top of the screen, above the PanelRef. Notice that the buttons appear inside a Toolbar widget. A Toolbar is a container specialized to contain controls like Edit buttons. Save your work using Ctrl plus S and return to Training App. Reload the alterations to the PCF using Alt plus Shift plus L. In the sidebar, select Social Media. Click the Edit button. When you click the Edit button, you can see the Update and Cancel buttons we added.",
