  "full_text": "The two-step quoting feature improves the quote performance by splitting the quote process into two parts. The part finishing the quote is run only after the price is finalized. In the based application, two-step quoting is only enabled in the commercial property line. Let's look at how it works by logging into PolicyCenter first. Start from any account. For example, write construction. Click Actions. Select New Submission. We will walk through a single policy, full application submission for the commercial property product. On the Policy Info screen, enter the required information. Move to Buildings and Locations. There is one default location. You can add new locations if needed. Each location requires at least one building to continue. In the Actions column of a location, click the down arrow. Select Add Building, then Select a new building. Enter all the required fields on the Details tab. In the Class Code field, type it directly or click the search icon to find the appropriate class code. Select a coverage form. Go to the Coverages tab. Select the Selecting Club. For Business Income Coverage, enter an income limit. Save the building information. Move to Blankets. Select the Blankets. Blankets. Blankets provides coverage for a combination of items with a single limit for all the covered items that are included under the blanket. For example, apply a coverage across multiple locations or buildings. This is optional. Move to Modifiers. Use the Modifiers screen to apply credit or debit factors that affect rating. Move to Risk Analysis. The Risk Analysis page is where any underwriting issues that might affect quote and binding of the submission can be viewed. You can manage any contingencies, prior policies, claims, losses, etc. on those tabs. Move to Policy Review. The Policy Review screen contains all the policy data for the submission. Two-step quoting is enabled for the commercial property line. Instead of a quote button, a rate button appears in policy transactions when the policy period is in draft state. Click Rate to generate the premium for the policy and bring it to rated status. During the process, it syncs the product model, validates policy data, checks underwriting issues at the pre-quote checking set. The Quote screen displays the total cost for the submission on the Read Only Quote screen. It displays the breakdown of the premiums at the bottom. You can edit the submission and rate again until you are happy with the premium. After rating completes, execute post-rating tasks by clicking Finish Quote to bring the policy to quoted status. During the process, it infers the forms, checks reinsurance, checks underwriting issue at the quote release checking set. Move to Forms. Review the forms that will be included in the policy contract. Move to Payment. The Payment screen appears after quoting, but before issuing the policy. This is where you select the desired billing and payment methods retrieved from the billing system. You can do several things after quoting, including editing, binding or issuing the policy. From here, you can issue the policy, which first binds the policy. You have successfully created a commercial property policy with two-step Quote. ",
