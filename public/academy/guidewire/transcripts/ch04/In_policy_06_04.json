  "full_text": "CommercialAuto supports asynchronous quoting. Clicking the quote button triggers asynchronous quoting when it is enabled, and the number of vehicles on the policy transaction exceeds the threshold. It runs the quote in the background, and users can navigate to other screens to work. Once the quoting completes, an activity is created to notify the user whether the quote process completes successfully or with errors. For training purpose, asynchronous quoting has been enabled. The coverable threshold has been changed from 30 to 3. We will create a commercial auto submission with four vehicles. Login as an underwriter Alice Applegate. Start from any account. For example, write construction. Click Actions. Select New Submission. On the New Submission screen, we will choose to create a single policy, full application submission for commercial auto. On the Offerings screen, select an offering which has predefined product details. Go to the Qualification screen. Answers to the questions may impact later functionality. The question Did agent inspect vehicles? Is an example of the filtered question. Clicking Yes opens another question. Enter the inspection date. Next, enter the policy contract details. On the Policy Info screen, you can edit the primary named insured, add additional named insured. Select the appropriate organization type. Policy details including the term type, effective date, expiration date, and written date, etc. appear to the right. Finally, the producer of record and underwriting company can also be edited. Move to commercial auto line. On the Commercial Auto Line screen, select Specifics for the product, fleet type and other details. Select Business Auto for product. Select Fewer than 10 units for fleet. Move to Locations. On the Locations screen, you can create new locations or add existing locations from the account. These are the garaging locations. Move to vehicles. The vehicles. The vehicles screen is where the vehicles to be insured are added. Click Create Vehicle. Select a garaging location. Select a vehicle type. Enter a VIN number. Enter the cost. Click the search icon to find the class code. Click Search. Select a class code. Select a class code. Save the vehicle information. Add three more vehicles to trigger asynchronous quoting. After adding vehicles, you must go back to the Commercial Auto Line screen. The product model is synced when the screen is loaded. The liability coverage is added under the Commercial Auto Owned Liability Group now. Click Clear to get rid of the frame at the bottom. Move to State Info. Move to State Info. Move to State Specific Coverages and Modifiers. Move to Drivers. Add Drivers Covered by the Policy. You cannot select Account Contacts on the Driver screen in the Base Application. You must manually add information for each driver. Save the driver information. Move to Covered Vehicles. Move to Covered Vehicles. The Modifiers screen displays the vehicle groups. Each row corresponds to coverages such as Liability and Collision. The column represents the vehicle group, such as AVO, Own Vehicles Only, or DVO, Designated Vehicles Only. The values can be overwritten if you have the Edit Covered Vehicles permission. If you make changes, a message will appear stating that the Covered Autos were manually edited. Move to Modifiers. You can use the Modifiers screen to apply credit or debit factors that affect rating. Move to Risk Analysis. The Risk Analysis page is where any underwriting issues that might affect quote and binding of the submission can be viewed. You can capture any contingencies, prior policies, claims, losses, etc. on these tabs. Move to Policy Review. The Policy Review screen contains all the policy data for the submission. Click the Quote button. Policy Center displays an alert that quoting will be processed in the background. To proceed, select OK. Until asynchronous quoting is completed, Policy Center displays a message at the top of the Policy Transaction screens indicating that the quote is being processed. The Policy Transaction is locked and cannot be edited. Only the Back and Next buttons are available. You can navigate to other screens to work. When quoting is completed, Policy Center unlocks the Policy Transaction and creates an activity that the quote is completed. Navigate to Desktop. Go to My Activities. Locate the activity related to the submission. The activity subject indicates whether the quote completed successfully or completed with warnings or errors. Click the activity subject to view the activity and the associated quote or validation results. In this case, the quote is successful. Policy Center displays the quote screen for the policy transaction and the associated activity in the Activity tab at the bottom of the screen. If the quote has warnings or errors, they can be viewed in the Validation Results tab next to the Activity tab. Other more serious issues, such as rating or unexpected errors, will appear on the Policy Transaction screen. Click Complete to close the activity. You can view the forms or payment screen by clicking the links on the left. Let's look at the Submission Wizard buttons at the top. At any point, you can click Save Draft to save the entered data, create a new version of the policy, or close the submission by selecting one of the options, Withdraw Transaction, Decline, or Not Taken. After quoting, you can do several things, including editing, binding or issuing the policy. There are two bind options. Bind only will bind the policy without issuing it. For example, the insurer needs additional documents before the policy can be issued. Let's issue the policy, which binds the policy first and then issues it immediately. The confirmation screen is displayed with several quick links. You have successfully created a commercial auto policy with asynchronous quoting.",
