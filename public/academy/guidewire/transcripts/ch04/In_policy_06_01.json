  "full_text": "As an underwriter. To create a personal auto submission in the base application, start from a person account, for example, Ray Newton. Click Actions. Select New Submission. On the New Submission screen, you will define the organization and producer code, if different from the default, or in the case of risk reservation. You can choose to create a single or multiple policies. Click Multiple. Selecting Multiple allows you to enter the number of submissions you want to create. The default limit is 5 submissions but it is a configurable parameter. This will be useful when the account holder wants to create multiple personal auto policies. Let's select Single again. Click the quote type drop down. There are two options. Full Application gathers the complete set of information needed to apply for a bindable quote. Quick Quote gathers the minimal information needed to generate a quote and can be converted to a full application later. Let's select Full Application. You can also select a different default based state or effective date if needed. Select Personal Auto from the product list. On the Offering screen, click Offering Selection. Select an offering which has predefined product details targeted for different types of customers. Click the Back and Next button or the Step link on the left to navigate within the submission. Let's click Next. On the Qualification page, answers to the questions will pre-qualify or reject the application. Click Yes for the question Any drivers with convictions for moving traffic violations within the past three years? It displays the text box to capture the explanation. Next, enter the policy contract details. On the Policy Info screen, you can edit the primary named insured by clicking the link on the name. Click Cancel to go back to the Policy Info screen. Click the down arrow to change the primary named insured to another contact. The policy address can be similarly changed. Policy details include the term type, effective date, expiration date, and written date, etc., which appear on the right can be edited. The producer of record and underwriting company can be edited. Click Next to go to the Drivers screen. You must add at least one driver. Click Add. You can create a new driver or select an existing driver, for example, Ray Newton. Enter all the required fields. Click the Roles tab. Enter the year first licensed. This will be pre-populated if the driver has been used before. You must select the number of accidents and violations for both the policy level and account level. If not set now, you will get a validation error while trying to bind the policy. You can come back to the screen and fix it then. Click Next to go to the Vehicles screen. This is where you add the vehicles to be insured. Click Create Vehicle. Enter the Vehicle VIN. The vehicle cost new is $25,000. The license state must match the default base state. If you want to change the base state of the submission, update the garage date location. Assign drivers to vehicles. Use Ray Newton 100%. Click Next to go to the Coverages screen. A coverage is protection from a specific risk. The coverages are available as configured in the product model. You can select a different term for a coverage, for example, the Auto Liability Package. Let's add the collision coverage that protects the selected vehicle. Go to the Additional Coverages tab. Add the Rental Car Loss of Use coverage. Go to the Exclusions and Conditions tab. An exclusion defines a risk that is explicitly not protected. A condition is policy provision that defines required behaviors for the carrier and insured. Click Add Exclusion or Condition. Click Search. Select Exclude Custom Equipment. Click Add Selected Exclusions and Conditions. Click Next to the Risk Analysis screen. The Underwriter Issues tab is where any underwriting issues that might affect quote and binding of the submission can be viewed, approved, or rejected. You can manage any contingencies, prior policies, claims, losses, etc. on these tabs. Click Next to go to the Policy Review screen. After reviewing all the policy data for this submission, click the Quote button. The Quote screen displays the total cost for the submission on a read-only Quote screen. It displays the breakdown of the premiums by vehicle at the bottom. Click Next to the Forms link on the left. The Forms screen displays the forms that will be included in the policy contract. Click the Payment link. The Payment screen appears after quoting, but before issuing the policy. This is where the desired billing and payment methods retrieved from the billing system are selected. Let's take a look at the buttons for the submission. At any point, you can save the policy data by clicking Save Draft, create a new version of the policy, or close the submission by selecting one of the options, Withdraw Transaction, Decline, or Not Taken. You can do several things after quoting, including editing, binding or issuing the policy. Click Bind Options. There are two bind options. Bind only will bind the policy without issuing it. For example, the insurer needs additional documents before the policy can be issued. Let's select Issue Policy, which binds the policy first and then issues it immediately. Click OK to continue. Now you have successfully created a personal auto policy. A confirmation can be seen with several quick links for you to navigate to the next desired scenario.",
