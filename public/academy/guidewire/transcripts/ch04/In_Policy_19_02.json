  "full_text": "In this demo, we will use the Homeowners Policy Line to learn more about generic schedules. To go to the Homeowners Line Coverage page, click Policy Lines, then Homeowners Line, then Coverages. Scroll down and click the Scheduled Personal Property Coverage. The Scheduled Personal Property is a Scheduled Coverage. Notice that this coverage has two pages that are not found in other coverages. Let's look at the Scheduled Properties page first. It contains field definitions to capture information for scheduled items, for example, item description. Next, let's look at the Scheduled page. On the Scheduled page is a link to another coverage HOP-Line Scheduled Cov item. It is a Scheduled item coverage used to set coverage terms, such as limit and deductibles used for rating purposes. Let's examine the Scheduled Personal Property in the application. Login is Alice Applegate. Next, open an existing Homeowners Submission. Click the down arrow next to Policy. This is the Homeowners Submission. Go to the Coverages page. Click Optional Coverages. Select the Scheduled Personal Property coverage. Click Add. The left columns map to the Scheduled Properties defined in the Schedule Coverages. The right side coverage term columns, for example, limit and deductible, are derived from the Scheduled Item Coverage. Next, we'll create new schedules with coverage terms in Product Designer. Now, we're back in Product Designer. Go to the Homeowners Line Coverages page. Now, we'll add the new schedule. Click Add. This is the Add Coverage page. Enter the code. Enter the name. Click the drop-down. Select Optional Coverages. Click the drop-down for Covered Object. From this list we can select any regular covered object. This is for a dwelling, so select Hop Dwelling. Next, click the drop-down for the Covered Object Type. Select Hop Dwelling Schedule Cove. After selecting the Scheduled Covered Object Type, two additional fields are displayed to further define the schedules. Enter a schedule code. Click OK. Notice the error message. This means that we need to define the schedule properties. Let's do that now. Click Schedule Properties. Next, we'll add Schedule Properties for the description of the item and the quantity. Click Add. This is the Add Property to Schedule screen. First we'll add the Description property. Enter the code for the Description property. And then the name. Next, we need to specify the type of this property. Click the drop-down. Since the Description property will hold text, select String Call 1. Click OK to save the property. Validate the changes. No validation errors. So let's add the Quantity Schedule property. Return to the Schedule Property page. Click Add. Enter the code. And the name. Quantity should be a numeric value. Click the drop-down to see what is available. There are two possibilities for this. Int Call 1 and Pass Int Call 1. Int Call 1 would allow the user to enter negative or positive numbers for the quantity. That really doesn't make sense when we need to know how many of an item they have. The Pass Int Call 1 will only allow positive numbers which makes sense for this. Select Pass Int Call 1. Click OK. Validate the changes. Again, no validation errors. So return to the Schedule properties. Click the Schedule page. Next, we need to set the most descriptive property field. Recall that we have description and quantity. Let's use description. Click the drop-down. Select description. Notice there are no Schedule terms available. Next, we'll fix that. Click Coverages. Click Add. Enter the code. And the name. Click the drop-down. Select Optional Coverages. Click the drop-down for Covered Object. Select the Hopdwell Schedule Cove item. The Covered Object type is selected automatically. Click OK. Click Terms. Click Add. This is the Add Term screen. Enter the code. And the name. Click the Term Type drop-down. We could use Direct, Option, or Package for this depending on the business requirements. However, to keep it simple for this demonstration we'll select Direct. Click the drop-down for the value type. Again, the value type depends on the business requirements. But we'll just use money for this. Click OK. Click the drop-down for Model Type. And select Limit. Validate the changes. No validation errors, so return to Coverages. Scroll down and click the Scheduled Coverage. Click the Schedule page. Click Select Item Coverage. Select the Scheduled Item Coverage. That completes the new schedule. This concludes the demonstration. This concludes the demonstration.  ",
