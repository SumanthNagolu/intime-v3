  "full_text": "In this example, Wright Construction wants a new policy for a recently acquired business. The business is a motel. I will walk through the steps to create a business owner's policy submission. Start a new submission for a business owner's policy. In the offerings, you will see an option for single or multiple policies. Selecting multiple allows you to enter the number of submissions you want to create. The out-of-the-box limit is 5 submissions. The number is a configurable parameter for account holders wanting to create multiple business owner's policies. In this example, I will select single and proceed with a business owner's policy submission. Backslash C backslash R. On the offerings screen, there are predefined product details targeted for different types of customers. In this example, there are two offerings, silver or platinum. On the qualification screen, answer the questions to qualify or reject the application. This question is an example of a filtering question that could impact risk. Next, enter the policy contract details. On the policy info screen, you can set the date quote needed. Edit the primary named insured by clicking the link on the name. Click the down arrow to change the primary named insured to another contact. The policy address can be similarly changed. In this example, I will stick to the defaults. In the business owner's line, you can set up details about the policy's coverage. First, I will specify the small business type. The policy needs a coverage for employee dishonesty, so I will add that in this coverage. Existing locations from the account can be added. If you create a new location at the policy level, it is added to the account level as well. You can edit the policy location by clicking the link on the location. Coverage is selected here only applied to the selected location. In the business owner's line, you can select the desired location. Buildings are the primary rating unit for the business owner's line. On the building screen, add the buildings at each location. Select the desired location anywhere in the row and add buildings to it. Enter all the required fields. I have to enter the class code for a motel. Now I will enter the premium basis amount and the building limit. I also have to enter a business personal property limit for this building. Now I will proceed to the last few screens before I quote the policy. The modifiers screen is where you can apply credit or debit factors that affect rating. The risk analysis screen is where underwriting issues or other risk related concerns appear. The final screen before quoting is the policy review. I am going to quote the policy now. Because I am comfortable with the quote, I will issue the policy. I have one more chance to stop issuance here. I will still issue the policy. Now I can view the business owner's policy.",
