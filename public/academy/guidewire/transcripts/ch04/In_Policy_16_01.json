  "full_text": "Underwriting rules are managed in the user interface and contain fields related to define and approve the underwriting issues. Log in as superuser. Go to Administration. Select Business Settings, Business Rules, Underwriting Rules. Clone an existing underwriting rule to see how the rule is defined. For example, PA, Primary Driver Under 25. Click Clone. On the Rule Details page, there are several fields that define the underwriting rule. Name identifies the underwriting rule in the user interface. Code must be unique and identifies the underwriting issue type. A checking set represents a point in a job at which conditions are checked to raise underwriting issues, such as pre-quote, bind or pre-issuance. A blocking point stops progress of the job until an issue is approved. In this example, the issue is raised at quote time but it blocks bind. Default duration specifies the property on the new approval page, and it indicates when an approval will expire. You can enter a description for the rule and a start and end date. Default duration specifies the property on the new approval page, and the new approval page, and the new approval page. In the applies to section, select which policy lines, jurisdictions, and policy transactions this rule applies to. The rule context provides policy data to be used by the rule. You can also create reusable variables. These are the list of predefined context for personal auto policies. This rule uses the context for each vehicle. In the Rule Condition section, create the conditions for raising the underwriting issue. In this case, the primary driver's age on a vehicle is less than 25. You can add a new criteria. Click the Expression field. The context objects based on the selected rule context can be used to create the left and right expressions. Click the arrow to select a mode for the expression. The list of modes contains formula, count, sum or lookup. There are also several options to choose for the operation. In the Underwriting Issue Details section, the issue key can uniquely identify the underwriting issue once it is raised. The value is compared with authority grants to determine if the user can approve this issue. Short and long description are used to display the underwriting issues on the risk analysis page. Both are localized. The fields are related to approving issue. If auto-approval is set to yes, the issue is automatically approved if the logged in user has the authority to approve it. Default edit before bind corresponds to the property on the new approval page. Yes indicates the issue will not be raised again if the policy transaction is edited after the issue has been approved. Default approval blocking point specification is This is the default approval blocking point when an issue is opened for approval. Value comparator defines how to compare the issue value to specify if it is within the authority. This is the list of available value comparators. Value format type defines which output formatter to use. This is the list of value formatter types. Default value assignment type specifies how to compute a default approval value from the value of the policy center. Policy center uses this value if the comparator is set to at least or at most. Fixed copies the issue value directly to the default approval value. Offset amount or offset percentage adds to the issue value by an offset amount or percentage to produce the default approval value. Click cancel to go back to the underwriting rules page.
