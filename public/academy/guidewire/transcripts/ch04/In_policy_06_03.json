  "full_text": "In this demonstration, I will walk through a homeowner policy submission. I am going to use Ray Newton's account and assume he needs a homeowner's policy. Now that I found his account, I can pull it up and begin a homeowner's submission. There are several options to choose from when I start the submission. Among them, there is an option to produce a single or multiple policies. Selecting multiple allows you to enter the number of submissions you want to create. The base configuration limit is 5 submissions and is a configurable parameter. This will be useful when the account holder wants to create multiple homeowner's policies. In this case, I only want a single policy, so I am selecting single in the state of California. and a full submission. After that, I select homeowners. Now I am in the qualification screen. On the qualification screen, I have to answer questions that can qualify or reject the application. The answers to these questions can also impact later functionality in the submission. The first options are for the policy type and coverage form. The policy type is for a dwelling, and the coverage form I am going to select is HO3. In this example, Ray will live in the dwelling, so I will enter this detail. Ray has mentioned that he will live in the home full time, so I add this to the details. There is no swimming pool on this home, so I will not select that option and move on to the next screen, Policy Information. In this screen, I want to make sure I enter the date by which I am going to select. After selecting the date, I will click Next and move to the next screen to enter more property details. The dwelling screen describes the dwelling covered with details about occupancy, hazards, animals and swimming pools. Additional interests appear in a separate tab. Note that additional interests can be configured using type lists. Ray describes the home's details including a local burglar alarm in the fire protection class. I add these details in the dwelling screen. Ray also explains that all the floors have fire alarms and that there is a partial sprinkler system. Ray also explains that all the floors have fire alarms and that there is a partial sprinkler system. Ray has not yet gone through the property to get details that may impact the rating of this policy. That's okay though, I can skip this screen for now without any problems. I am going to move to the coverage's details. There are already default values for each coverage part, but you must enter details that have an asterisk. Each policy type will have a different set of values. This is only applicable for the HO3 policy. Beginning with Coinsurance in Coverage A for the dwelling, I am going to enter 80%. Next, I am going to specify for this submission that Coverage C for Personal Property covers property loss using replacement cost. Coverage D requires that I enter a loss of rental income as yes or no. If I cannot rent out the property and suffer a loss of rental income, I can enter this option here. Since Ray is going to live here full-time and there is no loss of rental income, I select No. The prohibited use coverage is related to situations that often arise from natural disasters. If a civil authority prevents access to an undamaged property, then the policy holder is covered to some extent. The number of days can vary. In this example, I am selecting 45 days, which is a generous coverage. Two weeks is a more standard protection. Now that all the coverage details are in Policy Center, I am moving on to modifiers so I can complete the initial quote. For this demonstration, I will not add any more information and take the defaults for modifiers. Based on the entered data, no underwriting problems have come up. I will move on to review the policy details and quote. After I complete the quote, I can view all the associated coverage forms. These are really the heart of the policy. After reviewing the forms, I can take a look at payment options in the payment screen. Ray is happy with the quote, so we agree that we can issue this policy based on the entered data. The policy summary screen gives an overview of the new homeowners policy. This concludes the homeowners submission demonstration.
