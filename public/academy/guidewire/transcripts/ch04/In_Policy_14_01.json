  "full_text": "The forms page on a policy file displays the list of inferred forms. The inference logic is defined in the form pattern. Form patterns are managed on the Administration tab by users with the appropriate permissions. Go to Administration, Business Settings, Policy Form Patterns. Users can search for a form pattern by entering the form number, form name, product, or group code in the respective fields. For example, select the Personal Auto Product. Click the search button. This returns the form patterns that match the search criteria. Navigate the list by clicking the arrows. To view the details of a form pattern, click on the link to open it. For example, PA0148, Electronic Equipment and Media. To show you more details, we will click Edit. On the Basics tab, Code is a globally unique form pattern code to identify the form. Number is the form number. Technically, this is an arbitrary string, but it is typically driven by the form number as used by the issuance system. Policy Center uses the addition value in conjunction with the form number field to indicate if two or more patterns are different drafts of the same form. Name is the form's description. Any data related to this form collected after quote? Choose Yes to infer forms at both quote time and bind time, or No to infer forms only at quote time. When set to Yes, endorsement numbers are added to the form on a policy based on its priority. Priority is an integer used to determine the assignment order for endorsement numbers, and the processing order for forms during form inference. Reference code is used for customer integration purposes. Form names can be localized if the system is configured for another locale on the basis. In the Forms tab, the Forms tab is used for the form. On the Products tab, add the products that use the current form pattern. On the Transaction Types tab, add the policy transaction types that use this form pattern. The Jurisdictions tab has two panels. Policy Center determines if a form pattern is available for a policy using the Availability table. In this example, the form is only available in Louisiana. Jurisdictional replacement is the concept of one form replacing another form in a particular jurisdiction. The Policy Change tab contains settings for the form in Policy Change Transactions. Policy Center displays this tab if policy change has been added on the Transaction Types tab. On the Inference tab, you can choose what line the inference applies to, and any other criteria that will infer the form on the policy. You can select from the list of inference conditions. For example, selected coverage, condition, or exclusion is used. Click the search icon to search for a coverage, condition, or exclusion. Search for the coverages on the policy line. It returns the list of coverages that are defined in the product model. We will just go back to the form pattern without any changes. The Inference condition for this form pattern is, when the coverage for taped disk media exists. You can add any covered object fields to define the inference logic further. This is a list of objects that exist on the policy. Click Cancel without saving the changes. Go back to the Administration page for policy form patterns. The Add button allows you to add a new form pattern. Let's go to a sample submission to show that the forms is inferred when the condition in the form pattern is met. The submission is created. The submission is created with a vehicle in Louisiana. Go to PA Coverages. Then Additional Coverages tab. The coverage taped disk media exists and it matches the inference condition on the form pattern PA0148. Since the submission has been quoted, go to the Forms page. The form PA0148 is inferred successfully on the quoted submission. This is the end of demonstration for form pattern.",
