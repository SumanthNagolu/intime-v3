  "full_text": "Login to Product Designer. Click on the Products button. This is where a full insurance product can be defined. Note that a product definition is not exactly the same as configuring a product. Defining the insurance product using Product Designer includes defining the product model for a specific line of business. Changes to the user interface, business rules, or other programming details happen in Guidewire Studio. In this product list, you see the sequence of how specific insurance products will appear in the Policy Center application. After clicking on the product called Business Owners, you will see several related fields to define. These fields include the account type, which can be a company or a person. The product type field has two options, commercial or personal. This refers to the line of business type. For example, personal auto is personal, while business owners is commercial. You can define the policy term as annual, or anything else that you can use. The product type is relevant to the line of business. This is the default term that appears for the product early in the submission process. Let's take a look at the business owner product availability. Availability, in this context, refers to whether or not a SPECIFC product appears as something to select as a product option. Policy lines do not have a separately configurable availability framework. Instead, the policy line availability is tied to the product level. However, the policy line details such as coverages, coverage terms, exclusions, and conditions can be configured specifically for availability. Login to Product Designer.
