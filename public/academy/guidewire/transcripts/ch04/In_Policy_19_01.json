  "full_text": "The purpose of this demo is to explore the coverage terms in Product Designer. We're starting out on the Product Model screen. The coverages and coverage terms are associated with the line, so click Policy Lines. This screen shows the policy lines that are available. We'll continue working with the business owner's line as we did in the last demo. Next, we'll look at the coverage terms associated with the burglary and robbery coverage. Click Coverages. Click the burglary and robbery coverage. Click Terms. Coverages can have zero to many terms associated with it. This coverage has one coverage term. Notice that this screen shows the name, code, and model type of each coverage term. This coverage term is a limit model type. We'll talk about this limit now. Most coverages set a limit on the maximum amount that will be paid. These limits may be set on a per incident basis, for example, a maximum payment per auto accident, or on an annual basis. For example, a maximum total amount paid in any policy year. A limit is used on the burglary and robbery coverage to record how much coverage will be provided if a burglary or robbery occurs at a given location. Now, let's look at the coverage term. This is the coverage term screen. Just like coverages, coverage terms are controlled by availability and offerings. Here's the name field for this coverage term. The name of a coverage term can be translated into multiple languages if needed. To see this, I'll click the globe icon. This is the display key by language screen. Notice that this coverage term's name has been translated into multiple languages. We don't need to make any changes on this screen, so just click cancel. Next, we'll talk about the coverage term. This coverage term is the required field. Notice that this field is checked for this coverage term. This means that the coverage term is required for this coverage. Some coverages have optional coverage terms. This coverage term is a direct term type. This means that this coverage term will allow a policy center user to enter a numeric value. This coverage is using the direct term one database column. This database field will be used to store the limit value that is entered. For this term, we are using a direct term type to specify the limit. A direct term type can store a variety of types of data. For this term, we only want to store monetary amounts, so money is selected here. Let's look at what other options are available for this field. Notice that we can have count, days, hours, or even percentages. To set it back, just select money from the drop-down list. In the next section of this screen, we have a table. This table is used to specify the default value, minimum, and maximum values for this coverage term. The values are specified by currency. For this coverage term, these have only been added for US dollars. Next, let's look at the integration section. This section contains the model type, aggregation model, and restriction model fields. These fields have been specified for this coverage term. The last field is the reference code. This field is often used for integration purposes by downstream systems. Next, let's look at the liability coverage for business owners. Scroll down and click liability. Let's look at the terms for this coverage. This is an interesting coverage. Notice that this has a limit, a deductible, and a third term that doesn't have a model type. We'll look at these in detail. First, let's look at the limit coverage term. Notice the term type for this is package. A package term is a compound collection of limits or deductibles selected as a group from a list of predefined choices. Notice that this coverage term is using the choice term 3 column. This column is used because a package term has a set of predefined choices. Next, let's look at the packages. On this screen, we can see the packages that have been defined for this term. These packages are composed of a set of three values. Now, let's go back to the coverage term screen. Notice that the 300, 600, 600 package is the default value for this coverage term. Now, let's go back to the liability coverage. Click terms. Next, let's go back to the PD deductible term. A deductible is the amount of loss paid by the policyholder. Either a specified dollar amount, a percentage of the claim amount, or a specified amount of time that must elapse before benefits are paid. The bigger the deductible, the lower the premium charged for the same coverage. The purpose of this coverage term is to allow a policy center user to select the deductible that will be paid by the policyholder in the event of a loss. This coverage term is to allow a policy center user to select the deductible that will be paid by the policyholder in the event of a loss. Let's look at this coverage term type. An option term type is a value selected from a predefined range of coverage term options. This is like the package type we saw earlier, but this will be just a single value instead of a set of values. Let's look at the options for this coverage term. The options are no deductible, $250, $500, etc. Now, let's go back to the liability coverage. Click terms. Let's look at the third coverage term. Notice that this coverage term has a type key as its term type. This means that the values for this coverage term will come from the deductible type type list. This type list is defined using Guidewire Studio, but we can see the available values by clicking the down arrow for the default value field. Here are the values in the type list. Next, let's add a new coverage term to the liability coverage. Return to the liability coverage. Click terms. For the purposes of this demo, we'll create a test coverage term that uses a package limit. To create the new coverage term, click add. This is the add term screen. We'll use this screen to set up our new coverage term. Enter a code for this new coverage term. Next, enter a name. Click the term type drop-down. Select package. Use the default values for the remaining fields. Click OK to save the new coverage term. Notice the error message. Because we specified a term type of package, we must specify at least one package for this coverage term to be valid. Let's do that now. Click packages. Click add. This is the add package screen. Enter a code for this package. No need to change the available date at this point, so just click OK. Notice that we have a different error message now. We have added a package. However, we also need to specify the contents of that package before it is valid. Click contents. Click add. Click add. Recall that this package was 102550. We need to specify the meaning of each part of the package. Click the name field. Enter P1. Click the value type field. Click the drop-down. Select money. Click the value field. Enter 10. Now, add the second part. Enter the second part as shown here. And the third part. Click validate. We have an error message that we have a monetary term, but we have not specified the currency. Let's fix that. Click the package. Click the drop-down. Select US dollars. Now, validate the scoverage term again. Notice that we have a no validation errors message. Product Designer makes it easy to duplicate packages to reduce the data entry that we must do. Click duplicate. Set the code to 2050100. The currency is already set to US dollars, so no additional changes are needed. So, click OK. Next, change the content values of this package. Change the value of the first row to 20. Second row to 50. And the third row to 100. Validate the changes. No validation errors. This process will be repeated until all packages have been added. There's a lot more about coverage terms, but what we've seen so far is a good start. Refer to the Policy Center documentation on coverage terms for more information. This concludes the demonstration.",
