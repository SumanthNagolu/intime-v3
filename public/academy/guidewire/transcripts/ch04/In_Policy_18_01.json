  "full_text": "The purpose of this demo is to show how to work with coverages in Product Designer. Product Designer is used to view and configure coverages for PolicyCenter. Coverages are associated with policy lines, so let's look at these. Click Policy Lines. For the purposes of this demo, we'll look at the Business Owners line, also known as BOP. Click Business Owners line. Next, let's look at the coverages for this line. Click Coverages. This screen lists the coverages for this line. Notice that the columns show us the name of each coverage, the unique code assigned to that coverage, and the coverage category. The last column shows the covered object associated with each coverage. The term covered object is synonymous with coverable. Next, let's look at the details of one of the coverages. Click the Burglary and Robbery coverage. Notice that the covered object for this coverage is BOPlication. Once a coverage has been created, the covered object cannot be changed. The Existence field is currently set to Electable. This means that the coverage will not be selected by default, but it can be selected. Select the down arrow to show the other options. First, let's talk about the required value. This means that the coverage will automatically be added to the submission and cannot be unselected. Select Required. Click the down arrow again. Next, let's talk about the suggested value. This means that the coverage will automatically be added to the submission, like required, but it can be unselected. Select Suggested. Click the down arrow again. That brings us to the Defined by Script setting. This means that a developer can write a GOSA script to determine the existence of this coverage dynamically. Select that setting. Notice that the Advanced section automatically expands to show a few fields for this coverage. We're not going to talk about the initialization or removal script fields right now, but more information is available in the Policy Center documentation. I just want to point out the existence script field. If you have existence logic that needs to be determined dynamically, you can write GOSA code here to handle those types of requirements. We don't need to do that for this coverage, so I'll just set it back to Electable. Select Electable. Now let's look at the Category field. This coverage is using the Crime category. Categories are used to create logical groupings of coverages. Also, these categories are used in the Policy Center screens to group coverages. Let's look at categories for the Business Owners line. Here's the list of categories. Notice that each category has a name and a code. Let's add a new category. Click Add. This is the Add Category screen. Set the code to BOPTestCat underscore ext. And the name to Test Category. And then save the category. Click OK. Now that we have a new category, we need to validate it. Click Validate. Notice that there are no validation errors. Next, let's add a new coverage. Click Add. This is the Add Coverage screen. Set the code to BOPTestCov underscore ext. Set the name to Test Coverage. Next, let's set the category for this coverage. Click the down arrow. Select Test Category. Next, we'll select the covered object. Click the down arrow. Select Business Owners line. The covered object type defaults to Business Owners Cove, so we don't need to make any changes to that field. Also, the Available Date field defaults to the current date, so we just leave this as is. Click OK. Next, let's validate the coverage just to be sure everything is good. Click Validate. No validation errors. Next, let's talk about change lists. It's important to realize that the changes we have been making to the product model have been recorded in a change list. This makes it easy to review the changes before we make them permanent. To view these changes, click the changes icon. Notice that the Test Coverage and Test Category we created are listed here. Since these were created for this demo, we'll revert those changes. First, let's revert the coverage change. Click on Test Coverage. Now the change list is empty. This concludes the demonstration.
