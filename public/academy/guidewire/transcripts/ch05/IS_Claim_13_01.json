  "full_text": "This demonstration on managing contacts shows how to add contacts to a claim. Examples include adding both person and vendor contacts, which can be local or shared. The process of transferring roles from one contact to another is also covered. Claims Adjuster Andy Applegate logs into ClaimCenter. He locates the Andrew Williams claim in his desktop claims list and opens it. Claims Adjuster Andy has learned that there was a passenger in the vehicle involved in the collision, and he needs to add them to the claim. He navigates to the parties involved screen. Claims Adjuster The passenger is Kayla Marie. The only information he has about her right now is her phone number. To add the passenger to the claim, he clicks on the new contact menu button. Claims Adjuster And selects Person from the options list. He enters her name and mobile phone number into the new person screen. Claims Adjuster In order to save this contact, he must give it at least one role. Claims Adjuster When the new row displays, the related to field defaults to the claim. Claims Adjuster Andy will add the passenger role first, which should be related to the vehicle incident. Claims Adjuster He clicks the related to drop down. Claims Adjuster And selects the vehicle incident from the list. Claims Adjuster Next, he selects passenger from the roles list. Claims Adjuster He adds an additional row to the list view for the second role. Claims Adjuster He selects witness from the roles list, and keeps the default value for the related to field, which is the claim. Claims Adjuster He saves the new contact. Claims Adjuster Andy also found out that Mr. Williams requested that an alternate contact be added to the claim. Claims Adjuster To add another new contact, he clicks the new, contact menu button and selects person from the options list. Claims Adjuster Andy also has only a name and mobile phone number for the alternate contact, and he enters this information into the new person screen. Claims Adjuster He adds a role to the new contact. Claims Adjuster Selecting alternate contact from the list. Claims Adjuster He saves the new alternate contact. Claims Adjuster Mr. Williams also told Andy that he has chosen a vendor to repair his truck. Claims Adjuster Vendors are considered shared contacts because the same vendor can be used on multiple claims. Claims Shared contacts are stored in Contact Manager. Claims Adjuster Andy goes to the address book search screen to locate the auto repair vendor. Claims Adjuster Mr. Williams is going to use Mynake Car Care Center for the repairs to his truck. Claims Adjuster They are located in San Jose, California. Claims Adjuster Andy enters values for the name and city for the search. Claims Adjuster He clicks the search button to find the vendor. Claims Adjuster He selects the record in the search results to add it to the claim. Claims Adjuster The vendor's information displays in the new repair shop screen. Claims Adjuster Andy needs to add a role to the vendor in order to add it to the claim. Claims Adjuster Since the vendor will be repairing the truck, he selects the vehicle incident for the related to field. Claims Adjuster He also selects the role of repair shop. Claims Adjuster He adds a second role because this vendor will provide services for the claim. Claims Adjuster He selects Service vendor from the roles list. Claims Adjuster This role is associated with the claim, so he keeps the default related to value for the role. Claims Adjuster And he saves the new vendor contact. Claims Adjuster Notice that the claim now has 4 claim contacts, 3 persons and 1 vendor. Claims Adjuster Selecting a contact in the list highlights the contact row, and the details for the selected contact display below the list. Claims Adjuster Andy clicks on the row for Alyssa Grace to display her contact details. Claims Adjuster Notice the contact link status message that displays above Alyssa Grace's contact details. Claims Adjuster The fact that this contact is not linked to the address book indicates that it is a local contact, known only to this claim. Claims Adjuster Next, Andy selects another person contact, Cala Marie. Claims Adjuster Notice that this contact is also a local contact and is not linked to the address book. Claims Adjuster The last person contact, Andrew Williams, is also a local contact. Claims Adjuster Finally, Andy selects the vendor contact, Meineke Car Care Center. Claims Adjuster Notice that the link status for this contact indicates it is linked to the address book and is in sync. Claims Adjuster This means that the contact is a shared contact maintained in Contact Manager, also known as the address book. Claims Adjuster When linked contacts are in sync, Claims Adjuster The information in Claims Center matches the information in Contact Manager. Claims Adjuster Andy talks to Mr. Williams again. Claims Adjuster He has now decided that the alternate contact for the claim should be Kayla instead of Alyssa. Claims Adjuster He clicks Kayla Marie in the list of contacts. Claims Adjuster From Kayla's contact record, Andy initiates the transfer of the alternate contact role. Claims Adjuster The transfer role screen displays. Claims Adjuster The existing roles for contact Kayla Marie are listed at the top, followed by a list of other claim contacts and their roles. Claims Adjuster First, Andy selects the Alyssa Grace contact to transfer the role of alternate contact from Alyssa Grace to Kayla Marie. Claims Adjuster Then he clicks the select button. Claims Adjuster Notice that after the Alyssa Grace contact is selected, a message displays stating that she will no longer have any roles on the claim, and a second message identifies the roles Kayla Marie will have after the transfer. Claims Adjuster After reviewing the messages, Andy proceeds with the role transfer. Claims Center displays a final warning message. Kayla Marie will now also have the alternate, contact, role, and Alyssa Grace will no longer be a claim, contact because she will have no roles on the claim. Andy accepts the message to complete the transfer. The role transfer is completed, and Alyssa Grace has been removed from the claim because she has no roles. Kayla Marie now has the alternate, contact, role. Andy logs out of Claims Center. This is the end of a demonstration on managing claim, contact.
