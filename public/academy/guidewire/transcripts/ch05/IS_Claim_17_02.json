  "full_text": "In this demonstration, Betty Baker takes a call from John Albertson who reports that his home has incurred damage from a hail storm. As usual, Betty logs in to ClaimCenter. Betty takes a call from Mr. Albertson, who is reporting damage to his home from a hail storm. She clicks Claim, New Claim to start the new claim wizard. She enters Albertson, as the last name and clicks search. Although the search results are not in the case, it is not in the case, it is not in the case. When Betty returns two policies, she selects the second policy. This is the policy that has dwelling coverage. Betty wants to verify that she has the correct policy, so she clicks the policy number. She verifies with Mr. Albertson that the covered property is on Maple Avenue, and clicks close to return to the wizard. Mr. Albertson, told Betty that the storm was on January 6, 2019. Notice that the type of claim is property. This was determined automatically by the policy type. Now that she has the policy and law state selected, Betty clicks next to enter the details of the claim. Since Mr. Albertson is calling in with the claim, Betty selects him from the name field drop-down. She clicks next to move to the next step of the new claim wizard. The Add Claim Information screen is used for recording details about the claim, like loss date, location, and so on. Notice that the loss cause list includes causes you would expect for a property loss. These are different from the causes listed for auto claims. This list is restricted by the line of business model. For this claim, the line of business is property. Mr. Albertson reported that the damage was caused by a hail storm. Unlike an auto claim, a property claim includes a section with details about possible property damage. For example, it includes damage types of fire and water. It also includes a section on exactly what property was damaged. Was it the dwelling, or personal property? Since it was the dwelling that was damaged, Betty selects dwelling. Betty enters a description of the damage. She clicks next to continue. The services screen shows a list of services that are appropriate for a property claim. Just like the loss causes, this list is determined from the line of business. It does not include services typical for, auto, claims, like towing or rental. Mr. Albertson says that he does not need any help with services at this time. Betty clicks next to continue to the last step of the wizard. A customer service representative would not necessarily create exposures now. However, to demonstrate the relationship between policy type and valid coverages, Betty creates an exposure. Notice that under the Maple Avenue property, she can select dwelling, or earthquake coverage. That's because both of those coverages are on Mr. Albertson's policy. Betty selects coverage, a dwelling. She sets the claimant to John Albertson. She clicks OK to create the exposure. Now that the claim details are complete and the exposure is created, she clicks Finish to create and assign the claim. The claim is created and is assigned to the property team B group. Betty logs out of claim center. This ends the property claim and line of business demonstration.        She holds theount of claim center.               ",
