  "full_text": "This demonstration shows how authority limits help constrain payments and transactions. It reviews the definition of a reserve limit and how the limit impacts a reserve change. Finally, it shows how to modify an authority limit to restrict what a user can do. First, a system administrator logs into ClaimCenter to look at a user's authority limits. She navigates to the administration screens. And then to the user's screen to search for the user's. Search for a specific user. She searches for user Andy Applegate by entering part of his user name into the search criteria. She opens the Andy Applegate user contact record from the search results. The basic information for Andy's user profile displays. To look at his authority limits, she clicks the authority limits tab. Andy's authority limits profile includes three authority limits. The first is for total pay. The second line of the profile limits. The second line of the profile limits the total reserves on a claim to $15,000. This means that if Andy creates or changes a reserve so that the total reserves on the claim exceed this threshold, the transaction will require approval. The third limit allows Andy to make payments that exceed reserves without approval as long as the payment amount is less than $1,000 over the reserve. The system administrator logs out of ClaimCenter. Now claims adjuster Andy Applegate logs into ClaimCenter. On the desktop claims screen, he locates and opens the Ray Newton claim. Notice on the summary screen that the grossing current is $18,400. That is the total reserves. That is the total reserves for this claim. Now Andy goes to the financial summary screen. Andy heard from the garage where Mr. Newton took his car, and the repair costs are higher than the reserve. Andy needs to increase the reserve, so he locates the auto body reserve line and clicks the menu button. He chooses Edit Reserve from the menu. He changes the value in the new available reserves field to $1,400. Notice that this increases the reserve amount by $1,000. Andy saves the change. The transaction created for the reserve change displays at the bottom of the financials transactions screen. Notice the status is pending approval. Even though the transaction amount was only $1,000, it will increase the claim total reserves over the limit of $15,000. Andy returns to the financials. Andy returns to the financials summary screen to see the impact of the reserve transaction. Notice that the net total incurred for the claim is still $18,400, because although Andy created a reserve change transaction, it is not yet approved, so it is not reflected in the total. Andy logs out of ClaimCenter. This section of the demo shows what happens when a user has no authority limit for a transaction, and also what happens when additional restrictions are added to a limit. The system administrator logs back into ClaimCenter to modify an existing authority limit profile. She navigates to the administration screens, and then to the user's search screen to search for Andy Applegate. She enters the first few characters of Andy's user name and clicks the search button. She opens the user contact record for Andy Applegate from the search results. She navigates to Andy's authority limits. She puts the screen in edit mode to modify his authority limit profile. Andy currently has the adjuster authority limit profile. The system administrator selects custom from the list of available profiles to create a custom profile for Andy. Notice that the custom profile has automatically picked up the limits from the adjuster profile previously assigned to Andy. Now these limits can be changed, and they will only apply to Andy. The system administrator selects the two payment related limits in the profile. And removes them from the profile. She modifies the remaining limit for ClaimTotal reserves by adding a policy type restriction to the limit. Now the limit only applies if the claim is associated with a business owner's policy. Finally, she saves the changes to create Andy's custom authority limit profile. Now the system administrator logs out of Claim Center. Andy Applegate logs back into Claim Center to test the authority limit changes. He locates the Ray Newton claim in his desktop claims view and opens it. From the claim summary screen, he navigates to the financial summary screen to review the claims reserves. Andy will increase the claim cost reserves for the first party vehicle exposure. He locates the reserve line and clicks on the menu button. He chooses Edit Reserve from the menu. He changes the amount for the new available reserves to $1,401. As soon as Andy navigates out of the new available reserves field, Claim Center calculates the amount of the reserve change and displays it in the change field. He saves the change to create a new reserve transaction. Notice the error message at the top of the screen. Andy does not have the authority to submit this reserve transaction for approval. When he modified the reserve line in the first part of the demo, the reserve authority limit was not restricted by policy type. Now that this restriction has been added, Claim Center simply does not allow him to create the transaction on a claim that has a policy type other than business owners. He cancels the reserve change. He returns to the financial summary screen. Andy will attempt to create a check. He locates the auto body reserve line for the first party vehicle exposure and clicks the menu button. Notice that the reserve line menu includes no check creation options. Andy tries another approach. From the actions menu, he looks at the new transaction options. Again, there is no check option, because Andy has no payment related authority limits. Andy logs out of Claim Center. Now the system administrator logs back into Claim Center to change Andy Applegate's authority limit profile again. She navigates to the administration screens. She clicks on the Users and Security menu link in the left pane. She enters the first few characters of Andy Applegate's username and searches for his user contact record. She opens the user contact record from the search results. She navigates to Andy's authority limits. Puts the screen in edit mode. And changes Andy's authority limit profile from custom back to adjuster. She verifies that the limits are correct, and saves the change. The system administrator logs out of Claim Center. This is the end of the authority limits demonstration. This is the end of the authority limits demonstration.",
