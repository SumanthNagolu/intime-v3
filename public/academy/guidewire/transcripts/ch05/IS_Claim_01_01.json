  "full_text": "IDA Belt is a customer service representative for Succeed Insurance. This demonstration reviews the basic functionality available to her in ClaimCenter. The first thing IDA does every day is log in to ClaimCenter. IDA is taken to the Claim Search screen when she logs in. As a CSR, she can see three tabs on the opening page, Claim, Search, and Address Book. In this scenario, IDA has never navigated to a claim. IDA is taken to the simple search screen for claims. When she clicks the Claim tab, the system takes her directly to a No Claim screen. From here, she can either create a new claim, or navigate to the Claim Search. If IDA had navigated to a claim previously, this screen would show her the last claim she was working on. IDA is where IDA can go to search for claims. When she clicks the Search tab, she is taken to the Simple Search screen for claims. When she clicks the Search drop-down, she sees that there are several options from which to choose. She can search for claims, activities, checks, recoveries, or bulk invoices. IDA decides to perform a simple claim search. She can use this page to search using a claim number, a policy number, or names of anyone listed on a claim. IDA needs to search for any claims that involve Ray Newton. Since she wants to see all claims where Ray Newton has any involvement, she selects any party involved. Then she enters Newt as the last name. And clicks Search. The results show all the claims where Ray Newton is involved. Ray is involved in two claims, one where he is the sole claimant, and one where he is one of several claimants. Another search option is called Search by Contact. This search uses a free text search engine which allows for searches on partial names, phonetic names, or sounds like names. She is unsure how Ray Newton spells his name, so she enters Newt on. And clicks Search. Although she misspelled Newton, the search returns results with any claim with the name Newton. The name field searches for the contents in the first name or last name. She is now looking for claims with the name Frank. She isn't sure of the spelling, and enters F-R-A-I-N-K as the name. She clicks Search. Again, even though the spelling doesn't match, the results show all claims which include any party with the name Frank. The advanced search page includes more search criteria. Such as assigned group, assigned user, jurisdiction, claim status, and more. Claim Center also allows users to search for vendors which are maintained in the address book, or contact manager. Aida needs to find information about a specific vendor. She knows the name starts with A-B but isn't sure of the rest. She enters A-B as the name, last name. And clicks Search. The result of the search shows A-B construction, which is a vendor maintained in the address book. This is the end of the Customer Service Representative Basics demonstration.             DEMONSTRATION                  DEMONSTRATION of the guilt of guilt. of the guilt of guilt. you",
