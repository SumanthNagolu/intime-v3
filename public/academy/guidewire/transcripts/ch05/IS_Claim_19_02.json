  "full_text": "Once vendor services are created, an adjuster can manage those services. For example, he can track the exact status of a service, is it waiting for a quote, waiting to be completed, waiting for payment, and so on, the adjuster can update the status of a service based on information he receives from the vendor. If the ClaimCenter vendor was using a vendor portal, much of this management would happen through the portal. However, in this example, the adjuster enters quotes and invoices, and marks services as complete directly in ClaimCenter. There are two services on this claim. A towing service, which is perform service only, and a repair service, which is quote and perform service. Andy hears from Bills that they have accepted the work for towing Mr. Williams' truck. He starts by clicking the towing service. He sets the vendor progress to vendor accepted work. He accepts the default for the expected service completion date, and clicks update to save the changes. Some time later, Andy talks to Bills again and finds out that they have also accepted the auto body work. He clicks the repair service. Just as he did for the towing service, he sets the vendor progress to vendor accepted work. He accepts the default for the expected service completion date, and clicks update to save the changes. Now that both services have been accepted by the vendor, the work may begin. The next, action for the towing service is finish the work. The next, action for the repair service is add quote. After some time has passed, the work is completed for the towing service. And he clicks the towing service. He sets the vendor progress to vendor completed work. He also received an invoice for the towing service, so he clicks add invoice. He enters the description for the invoice. The invoice has only one line item, and it is for towing. The description for the line item is towing for Mr. Williams' truck to the shop. And the amount is $250. With all of the invoice information entered, Andy clicks update to save the invoice. Adding the invoice creates options in the details section to either pay, mark as paid, or withdraw the invoice. Straight through invoice processing is enabled in the base configuration, but Claim Center could not determine which reserve line to use for the payment, so it did not automatically pay this invoice. Andy chooses to pay the invoice. Paying the invoice opens the payment wizard with most of the fields completed. Andy verifies the basic information and moves to enter the payment information. He chooses the first party vehicle. Claim cost slash auto body reserve line. And sets the payment type to partial. The amount of the payment was completed automatically from the invoice, so he clicks next to continue. On this screen, Andy reviews the payment information. He sees there is a $70 deduction, and wants to find out what this is for. The deduction is for backup withholding. This is because the vendor's tax information has either not been supplied or has not been verified. And he clicks OK to return to the check instructions. The details look correct, so he clicks Finish to complete the payment. He also received the quote for the repair of Mr. Williams' truck. He clicks the Repair Service. And clicks the Details tab. He is adding the quote that he received from Bill's Quick Auto Repair, so he clicks, Add Quote. The quote says that it should take 15 days to complete the repairs. He adds the description of the quote. He adds the category, Labor, a description of the line item, and the amount of the first line item. The quote has two line items. One for labor, the other for parts. Andy adds a second line item for parts. He sets the category to parts, enters the description, and enters the amount of $400 for parts. With all the information from the quote, entered, he clicks, Update to save the quote. After the quote is entered, Andy can approve the quote. The actions he can take are Approve Quote, Request a Requote, or Revise the quote. Andy thinks the quote is in line with what was expected for the repairs, so he approves the quote. He accepts the default requested service completion date, and clicks Update. The process of entering the quote and the invoices, and marking a service as complete, all affect the vendor metrics. These metrics help monitor the effectiveness of a vendor. For example, if on the quote, they reported the work could be completed in 5 days, but it took 20 days, that would be reflected in the metrics. Bill's quick auto repair sent Andy an invoice for the repairs along with a note that the work is completed. Andy first sets the vendor progress to vendor completed work. Andy sees that the next, action changes to add invoice. He clicks add invoice to start the process. Andy enters the description of the invoice. The first line item on the invoice is for labor. He adds the description, and sets the amount to $500. He clicks, add, to create a new line item. This line item is for parts. He enters the description and sets the amount to $400. Andy checks that the line items match the invoice and that the total is correct. With that verified, he clicks Update to save the invoice. The invoice creation, automatically triggered creation of a check, because Claim Center could correlate the invoice with a reserve line. The next, action for the repair is now none, invoices paid. Andy logs out of Claim Center. This ends the managing services demonstration.
