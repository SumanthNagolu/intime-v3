  "full_text": "Over the life of a claim, the adjuster receives new information that could affect claim processing. Chris Craft is already logged into ClaimCenter. Later in the day, he hears back from Mr. Henderson with more information about the claim. Mark found a witness who verified that he was not at fault. Chris will use the loss details and parties involved screens to update the claim information. The Claim tab menu provides a list of Chris's recently viewed claims. He clicks the menu button. And selects the Mark Henderson claim. Angela Ramirez was walking by when she saw the Camry run a red light and hit Mr. Henderson. This means Chris needs to do two things. First, he needs to record that Mr. Henderson was not at fault, and second, he needs to record that there is a witness. He starts by opening the lost details screen. He then edits the lost details. On the lost details screen, he sets the fault rating to other party at first. He scrolls down to where he can see the lost details. He scrolls down to where he can see the witness section, and adds a witness. Chris uses the menu button on the name field to create a new person. He enters Angela as the first name. And Ramirez as the last name. Chris then clicks, update, to create the witness. He did get a witness statement from Ms. Ramirez, so he sets statement obtained to yes. Ms. Ramirez was walking by at the time of the accident, so she was a pedestrian. She saw the accident from 3rd Avenue. That's all the information Chris has for now, so he saves his changes. He returns to the summary screen. He notices two things have changed. First, in the high-risk indicators section, he sees the claim now shows that subrogation is in review. Secondly, he sees that there is now a subrogation menu option in the left pane. This is because the third party was at fault. There may be an opportunity. for succeed to recover the costs of the claim from the third party.
