  "full_text": "Access control lists are used to control access at the object level. For example, a user may have all claims access permissions, but they won't have access to claims that are outside of their security zone. This demonstration shows that for a given claim, users in different groups and security zones have different access to the claim. The ClaimCenter administrator logs into ClaimCenter. First, she navigates to the administration screens. And then to use a claim. List, users in security, users in security. The administrator wants to examine some groups to see the list of users in the groups, and which security zones each of the groups belong to. She searches for all groups with auto1 in the group name. There are three groups with auto1 in the group name, Team, A, Team, B, and Team, C. The administrator opens Team A. The auto1 Team A group is of type, auto, and is in the auto and property security zone. Two of the users in this group are Andy Applegate and Betty Baker. The administrator clicks the Groups menu link to perform another search. She is looking for groups with Western as part of the group name. She opens the Western Call Center group. The Western Call Center group is a new claim processing type group, and is also in the Auto and Property Security zone. Not only is Stacey Bain one of the users in this group, she is also the supervisor of the group. The administrator now knows that Andy and Betty are in Auto Team A, which is in the Auto and Property Security zone. Stacey Bain is in the Western Call Center, a different group, but that group is also in the Auto and Property Security zone. She logs out of Claim Center. In this part of the demonstration, Betty Baker checks to see if she can edit the rain new claim. Betty logs into Claim Center. And opens the search screen. She searches for any claim with the last name of Newton. The search returns three claims. Betty opens the second claim. Notice the adjuster assigned is Andy Applegate. She opens the status screen. Andy Applegate is the owner, or primary adjuster, on this claim. Betty can see and edit the claim. Notice the edit button, even though she does not own it. That is because the claim is using the default access profile, which allows anyone in the same group or security zone to edit the claim. Betty logs out of Claim Center. Stacey Bain is going to verify that she also has edit privileges on the Ray Newton claim. Remember that Stacey is not in Andy's group, but is in the same security zone. Stacey logs into Claim Center. Since the Ray Newton claim is not owned by Stacey, and she had not recently opened the claim, it is not in her claims list. She opens the search screen to find the claim. She searches for claims with the last name of Newton. Stacey opens the same Ray Newton claim that Betty opened earlier. And goes straight to the status screen. Not only can Stacey edit the claim, but she can also remove the flag. She can edit the claim because even though she is not in the same group as Andy, she is in the same security zone. Since she is a supervisor, she can also remove the flag. Stacey logs out of Claim Center. Andy Applegate logs back in. And selects the same Ray Newton claim. Then he opens the status screen. And edits the claim. Special claim permission is not set, which implies that the default access profile is in use. Remember that the default access profile allows any user in the owners group, or any user in the same security zone, to edit the claim. Andy changes the special claim permission to employee claim. This access profile grants view and edit access to only those users in the same group as the claim owner. In this case, Betty is in the same group as Andy, but Stacey is not. After setting the special claim permission to employee claim, Andy clicks Update to save the changes. By making this claim an employee claim, Andy has restricted access to only those users who are in his group. He logs out of Claim Center. Betty Baker now logs back into Claim Center. Since she is in Andy's group, she expects to still be able to see and edit the Ray Newton claim. Since she has recently viewed the Ray Newton claim, it is in her Claim drop-down list. She opens the status screen. Betty sees that the claim is now set to an employee claim, and that she still has edit permissions, even though she does not, own the claim. She has access because she is in the same group as Andy and the employee access profile specifies that anyone in the same group is granted those privileges. Betty logs out of Claim Center. Stacey logs back into Claim Center. Remember that Stacey is in the same security zone as Andy, but is not in the same group. Like Betty, Stacey recently accessed the Ray Newton claim, so it is in her claim drop-down list. Even though the claim was in her claims list, she no longer has access since the special claim permission was set to employee claim. The employee claim access profile only grants access to users in the same group as the owner. Betty starts a search to look for the claim another way. She enters Newton as the last name for the search. The search returns two claims where Ray Newton is a claimant. The claim that ends in 870, is not on the list because Stacey does not have access permissions for that claim. She resets the claim search. This time, she searches for the claim using the claim number. Even using the claim number, the search returns no claims that match. Although the claim does exist, she does not have any permissions on the claim. Not only can she not edit it, she cannot even view the claim. Stacey logs out of Claim Center. This is the end of the access control lists demonstration. Stacey logs out of Claimountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountount ",
