  "full_text": "Jurisdictional benefit parameters demonstration. In this demonstration we will review what benefit parameters are available and where they can be found. Workers compensation claims are partially controlled by parameters that are defined in ClaimCenter. To view and work with these parameters requires administrative privileges not granted to most workers. Let's log in as the system administrator and navigate to the administration tab. Expanding business settings. And WC parameters. We see that there are four menu links on the workers comp parameters menu, benefit parameters, PPD min and max, PPD weeks, and, cop mensibility parameters. Benefit parameters are based on jurisdiction. Each jurisdictional parameter has a jurisdiction and a start and end date. The combination of those values restricts the claims that are affected by the parameter. In the base application, there is sample data provided for several jurisdictions. For California, there are six parameters ranging in dates from 2013 to 2018. Each of the parameters may have differing values that will be applied to claims that fall within the start and end date periods. Looking at California for 2013. We see that the minimum weekly payment for total temporary disability, TTD, is $126. While the maximum is $728. While the maximum is $728. Using this as a basis for comparison. We can navigate to the next page of benefit parameters. And look at the benefits for 2018, the most recent year available in this sample database. The minimum weekly payment for TTD is now $143.70. While the maximum weekly benefit for TTD is $958.01. The start and end dates give a jurisdiction the ability to modify parameters over time. While keeping the original parameters and applying them based on the lost date. Now, to see these parameters at work. We will again assume the persona of Gerald Ikes. And log into Claim Center. We navigate to the Lenar Construction, Bob Tyre Claim. We will look at the indemnity exposure. To see what benefits, if any, have been applied. We see that the max and main comp rates match those we saw on the benefit parameter for California in 2018, the most recent period available. Notice also that the TTD weekly comp rate shows that it cannot be calculated. This is because there is no wage set for Mr. Tyre. On the lost details summary page. We set the average weekly wage to $1,000. After saving the new wage. We return to the indemnity exposure. And look to see what, if anything, has changed on the benefits card. The weekly comp rate is $666.67. That is 67% of the average weekly wage or AWW before injury. Now let's return to the lost details general screen. This time we will set the AWW to $2,000. This is more than twice the max rate of $958.01. This represents 45% of the $2,000 AWW. Which is less than the 67% of wages standard rate. And this is the case. As expected, the maximum stake comp rate overrides the percent of wages. Let's try one more AWW to finish verifying that the benefit parameters work as expected. This time we'll set the AWW to 100. This is less than the minimum weekly benefit of $143.70. So our expectation is that the weekly benefit. Will be set to the minimum amount. Even though that represents 144% of the pre-injury wage. We see that, as expected, the minimum comp rate also overrides the percent of wages. Now we have thoroughly investigated the implication is of this one benefit parameter. Our work as Gerald Ikes is through. But there are other parameters available besides the amounts and dates. So we will log back in as the system administrator. Navigate to the benefit parameters as before. Now let's look at the benefit parameters for Florida. Florida has several other jurisdictional factors. For example, there are special rules that apply to injured workers 70 and over. There is also an override formula for temporary partial disability. This concludes the demonstration of jurisdictional benefit parameters.
