  "full_text": "Andy Applegate is an adjuster with Succeed Insurance. In this demonstration, he sees that he has an urgent, activity to call Mr. Farley, an insurance customer. He reviews the policy and the notes on the claim to re-familiarize himself with the claim. Andy logs into ClaimCenter. When Andy signs into ClaimCenter, the first page he sees is the desktop activities page. Although most of the adjusters use the activity to call Mr. Farley, an insurance customer. The second page is the default, the first page is the default. He has decided to call Mr. Farley, an insurance customer. He opens his preferences from the actions menu to change his startup view to desktop claims. Andy selects desktop claims as his new startup view. He then clicks Update to save the changes. For the changes to take effect, he needs to log out and log back in. Andy logs back into ClaimCenter. Now he sees his assigned claims as soon as he logs in. He reviews the claims and sees that there are no new claims assigned to him since yesterday. Now he looks at the activities page to see what activities are on his list of tasks to complete. One of the key pieces of information about an activity is the name of the insured. In the default tabular view, the insured column is in the middle, and Andy wants it to be closer to the beginning of the view. He drags the insured column and drops it just before the due date column. Notice that the insured column now appears to the left of the due date column. Just to make sure that he doesn't have any activities that he needs to prepare for, Andy changes the activities filter to all open. Andy notices that there is an urgent activity to call the insured, Mr. Farley, scheduled for tomorrow. He has some time, so he decides to make the call now. Andy wants to make sure he is familiar with the claim before he makes the call, so he opens the claim by clicking the claim number in the activity. Andy scrolls down the page to see the notes on the summary page. He looks at the notes on the summary page, and now he remembers Mr. Farley. He realizes that Mr. Farley is probably trying to get the status on his vehicle. Andy scrolls back to the top of the summary page. Before he calls Mr. Farley, Andy adds a note to the claim file, that he is making the call. Mr. Farley does not, so Andy leaves a voicemail saying that he was returning Mr. Farley's call. He leaves his name and phone number, and tells Mr. Farley that he can reach him whenever it is convenient. He enters information into the subject and text fields of the note, and clicks Update to save the new note. Andy presumes the call is about the service for Mr. Farley's car, he looks at services. He notices in services, there is an action assigned to him to approve a quote for the repair. He wants to see if there are any documents associated with the claim regarding the quote, or an estimate, so he clicks Documents. He sees that there is a document related to an auto repair estimate. He notices that the icon next to the document name means that the document is not stored in the system, but rather is a reference to an external document. He clicks the information icon to see details about the document. Andy sees that the document is an auto repair estimate, or a quote, and that the document is not stored on the server. It is a paper document that is stored in a physical location like a file cabinet. He finds and looks at the actual document. Once he reviews the document, he decides to approve the quote. He starts by navigating back to the summary screen. He then clicks Approve Quote on the service. He checks the amount on the latest quote and sees that it is correct, so he approves the quote. He accepts the proposed requested service completion date. After he approves the quote, Andy sees that the next action is finish the work. There are no other actions required on the claim at this time. This ends the check work plan and documents demonstration.",
