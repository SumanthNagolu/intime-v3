  "full_text": "This demonstration provides a tour of the financial elements of a claim. It starts with a claim summary, moves to the financials summary, then reviews the exposures, transactions, and finally a check. Andy Applegate is an adjuster for Succeed Insurance. Several claims are assigned to him, so he periodically takes a quick look to see the status of the claim financials. Andy logs into ClaimCenter. His initial view is the desktop access. He has a list of the activities screen. He navigates to the claims page to see what claims are currently in his queue. He locates the claim for the insured Ray Newton and opens it. On the summary page, Andy sees that the gross incurred for this claim is $18,400, which represents the total of any open reserves plus total payments. He also sees that $2,000 has already been paid on the claim. Now that he has a high-level view of the claim, he navigates to the financials summary to look at the financial details for the claim. He examines the different exposures on the financials summary exposure view. Notice that there are four exposures. 1. Ray Newton collision. 2. Stan Newton Medical. 3. Beau Simpson liability property. And 4. Beau Simpson liability medical. The exposure view of the financials summary includes six financial measures. The first is open recovery. 2. Open recovery reserves, which are estimates of how much money might be recovered from others in settling the claim. Open recovery reserves are calculated by subtracting total recoveries from the total recovery reserves. Remaining reserves are the estimate of the remaining amount that the carrier still must pay out for the claim. This calculated value is all open reserves minus all approved eroding payments and future eroding payments. Future payments are the amount that is scheduled to be paid at a future date. 3. Total paid is the amount that is scheduled to be paid at a future date. Total paid is the amount already paid out for the claim. Recoveries are the amount of money collected to offset the claim payments, such as from salvage or subrogation. The last financial measure is net total incurred, the amount of money the company currently expects to pay for the claim. Now, Andy examines the Stan Newton medical payment exposure. 3. Note that the net total incurred is $3,500. There is a claim cost of $3,000 and an expense of $500. 4. Also, notice the remaining reserves is $2,000, and the total paid is $1,500. Now, Andy goes to the financial transaction screen so he can look at the transactions that make up the reserve line. 5. The financial transaction screen shows all existing transaction types for the claim. The Ray Newton claims financials currently include both reserves and payments. 6. Andy clicks on the sort arrow on the exposure column heading to order the screen contents by exposure. This makes it easier to view the transaction types for each exposure. 6. He sees 6 transactions for the second exposure, 3 that add to reserves, and 3 that are payments that reduce the remaining reserves. 6. The total of the reserve transactions for the exposure is $3,500. 7. Notice that the first two reserve transactions are for claim costs with a category of medical, one is for $500 and one is for $2,500. 7. The last reserve transaction is against the same exposure, but this one has a cost type of claim expense. 7. Remember that an expense is a cost that is incurred in the processing of the claim, such as retrieving a medical report, or getting a second opinion. 8. The next three transactions are payments made from the reserve lines. The total of these payment transactions is $1,500. 8. Subtracting $1,500 in payments from the total reserves of $3,500 results in remaining reserves of $2,000 for the exposure, as shown previously on the financials summary screen. 8. Andy navigates back to the financials summary screen to review the summary information again. 9. He verifies that the second exposure has remaining reserves of $2,000, total paid of $1,500, and net total incurred of $3,500. 9. Next, Andy wants to examine the medical payments for the second exposure, so he clicks on the amount in the total paid column for that exposure. 10. Notice that the total paid amount for the exposure consists of two payment transactions, each for $500. 10. Andy clicks on the first payment link to see what it covers. 11. Notice that this transaction covers a doctor's visit for $500, and that the check number is $10,436. 11. Andy navigates to the second payment. 12. The second payment is for physical therapy. 12. Notice the check number, 10,436, is the same as the check number of the previous payment. 12. Both of those payments, are for the medical payments exposure for Stan Newton. 12. Next, Andy navigates to the financial checks screen to look at any checks that may have been issued for payment. 12. There is only one check for $2,000. 12. Andy clicks on the check number to look at the details on the check. 12. First notice that the check is written to Ray Newton, that he is the only payee, and that the payment is for $1,900. 12. The gross payment amount is $2,000, which is reduced by the backup withholding amount of $100. 12. Scrolling down to the payments section, notice that there are multiple payments from multiple exposures. 12. There are three for medical exposures and two for the collision exposure. 12. Andy clicks on the magnifying glass next to the $400 payment for the collision exposure to view the payment details. 13. Notice that this payment is for a collision specialist fee. 14. It is an expense cost type and it erodes the reserve. 14. Now Andy clicks on the View Check button to return to the check. 15. Andy sees that the check has already been issued for a payment that covers several of the expenses. 15. Now he has an idea of the financial status of this claim. 15. This ends the demonstration for claim financial terms and conditions. 16.
