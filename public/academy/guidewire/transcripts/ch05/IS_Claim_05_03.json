  "full_text": "Welcome to the demonstration of the work plan in Claim Setup. I created this claim in the previous demonstration. Let's look at its work plan. ClaimCenter has automatically created a work plan with seven activities in it. Three of these activities, the three-point contact activities, are automatically created for every worker's compensation claim. ClaimCenter, the contact activity for the medical provider and the get initial medical report activity, are associated with the medical details exposure. And one, the get wage statement and tax status activity, is associated with the indemnity exposure. From the activities menu. I can add activities to the work plan manually. There are several broad classes of activities available. I will create a correspondence activity. It is a common practice to send a letter to the claimant, acknowledging the receipt of the claim. Most of the key fields are automatically filled in. I only need a description, to remind me whom to send the letter to. I can add the activity to the work plan. Then I click update to save the activity. The new activity has been added to the work plan and assigned to the claim owner. It has a high priority in a due date tomorrow. It is not associated with either of the exposures. Next, I will create a new claim to demonstrate some more aspects of automated activity creation. In the first screen of the new claim wizard. I enter hard. And click select. The accident. The accident. Took place this morning. I move to the basic information screen. The accident in question took place. The accident. The accident. The accident.         The accident. The accident.  The accident. The accident.       The accident.   The accident.   The accident. The accident.    The accident.              who is not in our records yet. Her first name is Eleanor. And her last name is Mackenzie. And her social security number is 234-232-345. I click update to save her data. Because Eleanor is also the injured worker. I select her name here also. And add that her relation to insured is injured worker. I move on to the loss details screen. This is an incident-only report, meaning that there is no injury requiring medical attention or time off from work. Ms. Mackenzie tripped and bonked her head against the wall of a hallway in Hard Hats HQ. This occurred during her ordinary working hours. She notified her employer of the accident immediately after it occurred. Since the accident took place at Hard Hats Construction's HQ, I select employer here. The injury description is fairly simple. because Ms. Mackenzie returned to her duties immediately, with no medical inspection. We regard the injury as minor. And it obviously did not result in death. The cause of the injury was tripping in the hallway. We will leave the primary and detailed injury types at their default values. The area of the body for this injury is Ms. Mackenzie's head. specifically, Her skull seems to have absorbed most of the impact. Ms. Mackenzie returned to her work duties with no medical attention and no time lost from work. Moving on to the assignment step. I assign the claim to myself. I click finish. I navigate to the claim to view the exposures and activities it has created. Because this is an incident only claim, Claim Center generated no initial exposures. Now, when I look at the work plan, I see that ClaimStunner has automatically created the five activities always created for a worker's compensation claim, the three-point contact activities, one to determine compensability for the claim, and one to do a file review in 30 days. Now, later in the day, Eleanor reports feeling dizzy. The company physician treats her with an ice pack and sends her home from work. Her boss, Pauline Rigby, calls to tell us about this. Now, I will enter this information. Pauline is also nervous about the possibility of a lawsuit, as Eleanor added that the floor was wet and slippery when she fell. So medical attention was required after all. Eleanor is losing work time. And there is the possibility of the employer being liable for the accident. I click Update to save the changes I have made. Looking at the claim summary, I see that there are now three exposures associated with this claim, a medical details exposure, an indemnity exposure for lost time, and an employer liability exposure in case of lawsuit. Next, I'll look at the work plan. Two new activities have been added to the work plan, a get wage statement activity, associated with the indemnity exposure, and a get initial medical report activity, associated with the medical details exposure. This concludes the demonstration of automated work plan generating.",
