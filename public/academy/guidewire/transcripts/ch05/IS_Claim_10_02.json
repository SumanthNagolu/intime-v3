  "full_text": "Welcome to the issuing payments demonstration. In this demonstration, Gerald Ikes issues two payments for the Bob Tyre claim. One way to navigate to a claim from the desktop is to click its claim number. Since Gerald is about to issue payments, he needs to make sure that the claim and its exposures are all at the ability to pay validation level. From the actions menu, Gerald selects the validate claim and exposures action. And tests the validity of the claim to the ability to pay validation level. There are no validation errors, so Gerald clicks clear to close the validation results pane. Gerald has received bills from the medical provider and the nurse case manager. He will issue payments to cover these bills. The first payment is to the medical provider, Dr. Jim Kildare. Next to the reserve line for medical costs, Gerald clicks the picker. And selects create check. Remember that, in ClaimCenter, the word check refers to any payment. The payment instrument, be it's a payment instrument, be it cash, electronic, or a paper check. On the first step of the check wizard, the payee is selected, and details about them added to the check object. The medical provider is named Dr. Jim Kildare. On the second step of the check wizard, Gerald will enter details about the payment. A further bill is expected from Dr. Kildare when the cast is removed from Mr. Tyre's ankle. In the comments field, Gerald enters a note about the specific service for which the payment is made. A single payment instrument may cover more than one expense item within the cost type and cost category selected for the check. In this case, there will only be one expense item. The expense item is a payment to Dr. Kildare, so Gerald selects the doctor expense category. Note that the categories are filtered so, for example, only categories relevant to a medical expense appear here. This bill covers an emergency clinic visit, testing, x-rays, diagnosis, and treatment. The third step of the check wizard contains information which may not be relevant for all payment instrument types. None of the information gathered here is relevant to this check, so Gerald clicks finish to submit the payment for processing. The status of the check is awaiting submission. ClaimCenter processes payments in a batch on a regular basis, typically once per day. Until the batch is run, the status of all new checks will be awaiting submission. If Gerald now looks at the transaction screen. He sees a payment transaction in the amount of $3,875 against the claim cost, medical exposure. It was created by Gerald Ikes and its status is awaiting submission. Now Gerald will enter the second check. Now Gerald will enter the second check. He returns to the financial summary screen. This payment will be made against the reserve set aside for case management. Once again, he selects create check from the picker dropdown. On the first step of the check wizard, he selects the nurse case manager. Gerald, who, for this claim, is Suzanne Roche. The payee type does not autofill for payees with only one role. The payee type is vendor. Gerald navigates to step 2 of the check wizard. In this case, Ms. Roche does not expect to do any further work on this case, so she has sent us a final bill. Setting a payment to final has implications down the road. Gerald enters a note to the effect that this is the full and final payment to Ms. Roche for this claim. Ms. Roche's final bill, and our payment to her, is for $650. He navigates to the next page. And clicks finish to submit the claim. Once again, Gerald navigates to the transaction screen. Here, in addition to the $650 payment transaction, there is a minus $350 reserve transaction. The purpose of a reserve transaction is to zero out any balance remaining on a reserve when the final payment has been made against it. So now, if Gerald navigates to the financial summary screen. He sees that there are $625 remaining for the claim cost reserve line. While there is no money left in the case management reserve line, because it has been zeroed out. This concludes the issuing payments demonstration.",
