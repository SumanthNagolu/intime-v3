  "full_text": "Welcome to the Creating and Changing Reserves demonstration. Gerald Ikes, an adjuster, logs on to ClaimCenter. Due to the pandemic, there is a shortage of customer service representatives today. So Gerald is taking accident reports and entering them into ClaimCenter as needed. Gerald receives a call from Lenar Construction. So he starts the new Claim Wizard, types Lenar for the organization name search criterion, and clicks the search button to find policies. Lenar Construction's workers' compensation policy is the sole record returned. The accident being reported took place today. Gerald navigates to the basic information page. The incident is associated. The injured worker is associated with Lenar's headquarters at 846 Yount Lane in Hollywood. The call reporting the accident came from Jennifer Albee. Ms. Albee is a human relations specialist at Lenar. The injured worker is not in our records. So Gerald will add him. The injured worker's first name is Bob. And his surname is Tyre. Mr. Tyre's social security code is 882-54-6378. And he lives at 5 964 Sabo Road in Hollywood. Bob was inspecting some brickwork. On the second story of a new house. When he lost his footing and fell. From the letter. The accident took place at the premises of a Lenar Construction customer. At 5490 Hughes Road in Hollywood. The accident took place at the end. Because the premises where the accident took place is neither that of the employer or any lissie thereof, Gerald picks other for the accident premises. He appears to have broken his left ankle. A broken ankle would be considered a minor injury. And nobody is dead. For the cause of injury, source. Gerald selects fall, slip, or trip injury. And for the detailed cause, source. He selects fall, slip, or trip injury from ladder or scaffolding. For the primary injury type, the default, specific injury is correct. The detailed injury type is fracture. The body area involved is the lower extremities. While the specific body part is the ankle. When you select body parts that are reflected from side to side, claim center makes the side field available. It is Mr. Tyre's left angle that is in this case affected. Mr. Tyre was assisted TP a CARF and taken to the ER, where medical treatment was applied. And Mr. Tyre will certainly miss at least a few shifts because of the injury. Gerald moves on to the last step of the new claim wizard. This is the save and assign claim step. He assigns the claim to himself. And he saves it. This takes him to the new claim saved page, which is unusual in having no sidebar links. He clicks the new claim number to navigate to the claim. Gerald looks at the summary and sees that the financials have zero gross incurred, meaning that there are no reserves set for this claim. He sees that the claim is in review for subrogation. That is an automatic setting based on the loss type. When the loss type is fall from ladder, there is a higher probability of subrogation, so claim center sets that automatically. He also notices that there are two exposures on the claim, medical details, and indemnity. He wants to add a reserve line to the medical details exposure, so he selects it from the exposures list. At the top of the medical details exposure screen are a number of action buttons. Gerald clicks create reserve. The exposure column for the new reserve is preset to one medical details. This reserve is being made against expected claim costs. While the cost type is about where the money is going to the cost category is more about where it is going. That is, the purpose of the planned expenditure. In this case, the money is for medical expenses associated with Mr. Tyre's ankle injury. The usual and customary costs for a broken ankle are generally in the range of $4,000. So Gerald enters that amount into the new available reserves column. There is another reserve line to be added. Again, the medical details exposure is automatically selected. This will generally be the case when reserves are added directly from an exposure. This reserve is for adjusting in other, A&O, expenses. In the case of claims, A&O reserves cover expenses associated with the claim, but not directly for making the claimant whole. For example, for a large medical reserve, it is common to add a medical case management expense, for a nurse case manager who tracks treatment and ensures that all expenses being reimbursed are necessary and proper. Gerald estimates case management costs for this exposure at $1,000. Gerald enters this amount. Those were the only reserves needed for this exposure, so Gerald saves his work. This brings Gerald to the financials, transactions screen. Some time later, he discovers that the proper amount for the claim cost reserve line is $4,500, so he comes to this screen and clicks the reserve button for that reserve. On the reserve details screen, he clicks the edit button. And edits the amount for the reserve line by replacing the first zero with a five. The amount is now correct, so Gerald clicks save. Saving the new transactions brings Gerald back to the transactions screen. Although there are two transactions highlighted here, they are both related to the same reserve line. This concludes the demonstration of creating and changing reserves.
