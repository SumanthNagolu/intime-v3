  "full_text": "In this demonstration, a group supervisor approves a transaction and reviews the claim financials to see the impact of the approval on the claim total reserves. Claims adjuster Andy Applegate logs into ClaimCenter. In the desktop claims view, he locates the Ray Newton claim and opens it. He goes to the financials summary screen. Notice that the total incurred is $18,400. Now Andy navigates to the financials. Now Andy navigates to the financials transactions screen. He notes that the last reserve transaction is for $1,000, and is pending approval. Andy opens the reserve transaction to see more details. The reserve details show that there is currently $400 left in open reserves for the first exposure for claim cost, auto body. This reserve transaction is for $1,000. And is pending approval. Andy logs out of claim center. Andy logs out of claim center. Sue Smith is Andy Applegate's supervisor. Now Sue logs into claim center to review and approve the reserve transaction. When Sue Smith logs in, her default view is desktop activities, showing her activities for today. Notice there are several activities that need her attention. The first activity in the list is the review and approve reserve change activity for the Ray Newton claim. Sue opens the activity. The approval activity opens in a worksheet view in the lower part of the screen. The first section of the activity provides an approval history. Sue is the first supervisor to approve the transaction, so this list currently has only one line. If an approval activity is approved is approved, a new activity is approved, a new activity is approved, a new activity is approved, a new activity is approved, and another line is added to the approval history. This process continues until a user with sufficient authority approves the activity. The next section of the activity provides relevant information about the reserve, such as the amount of the transaction and the current open reserves for the exposure. The cost type and cost category are also included. This information helps the approver review the transaction. The toolbar buttons allow Sue to approve, reject, view the full reserve request, or edit all the reserves for the claim. In this case, Sue is aware of the additional potential costs and approves the request. When Sue approves the transaction, the updated work plan shows the open activities for the Ray Newton claim. The reserve request is now complete so it isn't in the list. Sue can verify that the activity was completed by changing the work plan filter to show all activities. The list of all activities includes the review and approve reserve change activity, and shows that it was completed by Sue Smith. Next, Sue looks at the financial summary screen again. Notice that the total incurred for the claim is now $19,400, which includes the newly approved reserve increase of $1,000. Notice also that the reserve change was to the first party vehicle for claim cost against the auto body category. Sue Smith logs out of claim center. This ends the demonstration on approving transaction.                    the                          the                           ",
