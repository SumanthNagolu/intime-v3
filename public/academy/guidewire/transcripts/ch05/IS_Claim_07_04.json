  "full_text": "Welcome to the demonstration of the loss details screen. Eileen Lang is still working on the Bev Blackburn claim. She has received additional information relevant to determining compensability for the claim. She navigates to look at the loss details screen. The loss details screen is the key to determining whether the claim is a covered event. The compensability factors and compensability decision sections are where the decision is actually made, but other information on the screen is relevant else. Eileen clicks Edit to add information to the screen. Description and specific activity being performed are important fields that help determine whether the youth's actions at that time fall in line with the terms of coverage. The injury section helps to estimate what medical costs may be expected prior to receiving actual invoices. Eileen has received information that Bev Blackburn was crushed from the neck to the pelvis. In addition, she has received Bev's wage data. Bev worked 5 days per week, 8 hours per day, for $15.50 per hour, making an average weekly wage of $620, paid bi-weekly. Bev was hired on July 1, 2014. Since then, FitRight Manufacturing operates solely in Illinois. And that is where Bev was hired. Since her date of hire. Bev has consistently been a full-time employee. Bev's manager is not in our database yet. So Eileen adds her. Her first name is Sam. And her last name is Benedict. Eileen clicks Update to save Sam Benedict and return to the loss details screen. Bev worked a typical work week of 5 days. Putting in a solid 8-hour day. The company's payment schedule for hourly workers. Is bi-weekly, with payment made one week after the end of the pay period. FitRight Manufacturing will pay the full day's wages for the day on which the accident took place. But they are leaving anything beyond that to succeed insurance to determine. And, of course, the concept of modified duty is irrelevant. In addition, we have received a copy of the coroner's report. Eileen adds the details of the coroner's report to the claim. The Metropolitan Report Type Is Coroner Reports The date on which Bev died Is the date of the accident. The report was filed by the Tazewell County Coroner's Office. And the report was issued today. Tazewell County is in Illinois. Eileen types the first few letters, ILL, to select it quickly. Clicking OK saves the report and returns to the loss details screen. Note that once the report is saved it cannot be further edited. The coroner's report indicates that there were no drugs involved. This allows Eileen to make a final determination that the claim is compensable. Eileen has determined that all qualifying factors for compensability are present and correct. With the determination of compensability complete, Eileen saves her work. The final step of determining compensability Is to complete the determined compensability activity in the claims work plan. Eileen clicks Complete. The activity worksheet closes And the activity is removed from the all open activities list. This concludes the demonstration of the loss details screen.",
