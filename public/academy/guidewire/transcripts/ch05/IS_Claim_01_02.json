  "full_text": "IDA is already logged into ClaimCenter. She gets a call from Mr. Henderson who wants to report an auto accident he had today. IDA will use the new claim wizard to create an auto claim. She uses the claim tab. To navigate to the new claim screen where she can create a claim. IDA enters part of Mr. Henderson's name as the search criteria. She searches for Mr. Henderson's policy. If multiple policies had matched the claim, criteria that IDA entered, she would see a list of policies in the middle of the screen. Since only one policy matched, she sees details of the policy, including claim history. Since there is only one policy for Mr. Henderson, it is automatically selected for this claim. Mr. Henderson told IDA that the accident happened today, so she uses the calendar icon to select the date. She clicks today to select today's date. IDA verifies the date. IDA verifies the date. She says that Mr. Henderson's address is still 85 Circle Road in West Lake Village. Now that she is sure she has the correct policy and person, she is ready to gather information for the claim. She proceeds to the next step of the new claim wizard. Since she is talking to Mark, she uses the drop-down to select Mark Henderson as the reporter. The relation to insured field automatically updates to self, since he is the insured. On the right, she sees that two cars are listed on this policy. The claim center shows both cars on the policy as possible involved vehicles. Mr. Henderson tells IDA that the vehicle involved is the 1991 Ford wagon. When she selects a vehicle, the page shows the coverage information for that vehicle. By selecting the 1991 Ford wagon, she identifies it as an incident on this claim, which is an item that was potentially damaged. Next, IDA gathers more details about what happened. Mark tells her that he was hit by another car in the intersection. She enters that information into the what happened field. Because there is another car involved, IDA chooses collision with motor vehicle as the loss cause. Mark also tells her the intersection was at 3rd and El Camino, in San Mateo, California. As IDA enters the city, claim center automatically generates a list of potential matches from previously imported cities. The state and zip code are auto-filled because of the zone data we imported. Mark describes the damage that was done to his vehicle. IDA uses the vehicle menu button to edit the vehicle information. IDA enters the description of the damage. The only detail is that there is severe damage to the right side of the car. IDA is the vehicle. Since that is the only detail that Mr. Henderson has, IDA saves her changes. Mark tells IDA that he has information on the car and driver that hit him. She adds a vehicle to the claim. The car that hit Mark is a 2005 Toyota Camry. The car that hit Mark sustained damage to the front bumper and fender. The airbags were deployed. Mark collected the other driver's name and information, so IDA adds a driver to this vehicle. The other driver was Maria Tostado. The other driver was Maria Tostado.  Ida enters Maria's phone number. Ida clicks OK to save the driver details. She clicks OK once more to save the vehicle details. She is now done with the claim details and clicks next to move to services. Mark tells IDA that he needs help finding an auto body shop to repair his car. On the services screen, IDA begins a search for a repair shop. She checks the box for a body shop. She wants to search for a convenient body shop, so she clicks the menu button to begin the search. She selects search. On the search screen, she narrows the search by limiting the type of service Mark needs, which is auto body. She enters San Mateo as the city. She searches for a vendor. The search results show that MB Garage is in San Mateo, so she clicks select. IDA uses the drop-down on the service address to select a convenient service location for Mark. That is the only service that Ida needs to arrange for now, so she continues to the final new claim wizard step. Ida is using the automated assignment rules to assign this claim, so she clicks Finish to complete the new claim wizard and assign the claim to an adjuster. As the last step, she tells Mark that his claim was assigned to Chris Craft, and that the adjuster will be in touch soon. This is the end of the customer service representative new claim wizard demonstration.
