  "full_text": "Chris Craft, the adjuster assigned to the new Mark Henderson claim, reviews his desktop activities and the claim work plan to determine what he needs to work on for the claim. He also reviews the claim summary for an overview of the claim. At the start of the day, Chris logs into ClaimCenter. When Chris logs in, he is taken to the activities screen on the desktop tab, which shows him activities that he is responsible for. The left-hand navigation panel shows items which have numbers of items that he is responsible for. He does not need to run into theount of theountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountountount These activities are all associated with the new claim that was just assigned. Remember, activities are tasks that need to be done as part of working a claim. Chris clicks the claim number on one of the new activities for Mark Henderson. This opens the claim so he can have a closer look. The first screen he sees is the claim summary page. The top section of the summary screen shows essential information about the claim. Chris can see that the claim has been open for three days. The financial section at the top shows the total gross incurred is $3,000, and that nothing has been paid. There are no high-risk indicators. The loss details section shows the loss date, when succeed was notified, the location of the loss, and the description. The exposure section shows there is one exposure, which was probably created, automatically during claim creation. He can also see the planned activities for this claim. This entire screen is a view of a single claim. There are links on the left that will show more details about this claim. After looking at the claim summary, Chris looks at one of the activities that he is assigned. The activity is to make initial contact with the claimant. He calls the insured, but they don't answer, so he leaves a voicemail. The next step is to update the activity with a description of what he did, so he edits the activity. Chris enters a description of what he did for the activity. Then he clicks, update. Then he marks the activity as complete. When he does, the worksheet, the frame at the bottom of the screen, disappears and the activity is removed from the all open activities list. That's because he marked it as complete, and it is therefore no longer an open activity. He also knows that he needs to send an acknowledgement letter for this claim. He clicks the actions menu. He selects, send claim acknowledgement letter, under new activity, correspondence. The default values are acceptable, so Chris doesn't add any information to the activity. He clicks, update, to create, to create and assign the activity. Since he didn't specify an owner of the activity, it is automatically assigned to the claim owner, which happens to be Chris. He opens the new activity. The activity is to create a letter, and a letter template is already associated with this activity, which is handy. He clicks the create document button to create the letter. Before claim center creates the document, it allows him to change a few things, like the to, and from, fields, and the copy field. Again, the default values are fine, so he creates the document. When claim center creates the first pass or initial letter, it uses a document template that was created by the configuration team, so that adjusters don't need to create it from scratch. Claim center automatically fills in all of the claims specific data that it can, from the claim. The view edit button downloads the document where the adjuster can view, or, edit it. Chris clicks view edit to get the document. Chris needs to update his phone number. He enters the correct phone number. He saves his changes. He wants to save it as a new document. He changes the name to be more meaningful and saves the document. Since he changed the document, he clicks yes. When he does, he is prompted for the location of the edited document. He browses for the changed document. He clicks open to select the document. Chris knows that this is the final version of the letter, so he changes the status to final. He is finished creating the letter and updating this activity, so he clicks update. That was all he needed to do to complete this activity, so he marks it as complete. Chris wants to make sure the document was added to the claim, so he clicks documents. He sees that the letter he created and edited is attached to the claim and is marked as final.
