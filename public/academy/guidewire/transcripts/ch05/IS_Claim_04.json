  "full_text": "Welcome to the new Claim Wizard demonstration. As Eileen Lang, an adjuster, I need to enter a new workers compensation claim for hardhat construction. I log into Guidewire using my username and password. And I click Login. On the desktop, I click the Claim menu. And select New Claim. In the Organization Name field, I type hardhat, the beginning of the insured company's name. And click Enter to find policies which belong to matching organizations. To enter the date, I click the Calendar Picker button. For purposes of this demonstration, the date of the injury was one month ago. Which is to say October 22nd. When I click the date, the calendar picker automatically closes. The time of loss is optional, but I know it is 7.30 am, so I enter. The location is the location.  Now that this information is entered, I click Next. On the Basic Information step, I enter the location by clicking the picker. And selecting Hardhat Construction's Headquarters location. The accident was reported by a hardhat employee who is not in our database. I will add her to the claim by clicking New Person. By entering her first name, Lily. And her last name, Montez. This is all the information I need about her for now. So I click Update. Lily's relationship to Hardhat Construction. is that she is an employee. The injured worker also is not in our database. I will add him to the claim. His first name is Carrie. And his last name is Jones. Next, I enter Mr. Jones' social security number. His phone number is 650-555-8921. Jones' address is 3512 Centauri Court. In the city of Los Angeles. Which is in the state of California. His zip code is 95115. This is Mr. Jones' home address. This completes the information needed for Kerry Jones. So I click update. And now I move on to the add claim information page of the new claim wizard. This is an incident only claim report, meaning that it is being entered for purposes of making a record, but no payments are expected. Mr. Jones was injured by falling from a ladder. This occurred while he was going about his normal job duties. The employer was notified immediately. So I navigate to last month. And select the 22nd. The accident took place at. Hardhat Construction's main office. At first, Mr. Jones believed that his arm was broken. The accident clearly was not fatal. Though the cause of the injury is implied in the description above, it is required here. So I select the fall, slip, or trip injury option. When he had recovered from the fall, Mr. Jones moved his arm and realized it was just badly bruised, so no medical attention was required. As a result, no time was lost from work. That concludes this step, so I move on to step 4. Finally, I will assign the claim to myself. Meaning, in this scenario, I lean Lang. I click on the claim.  I click on the claim. This completes claim creation with the new claim wizard. I note the claim number, 000-00-000103. And I log out of Claim Center. This concludes the demonstration of the new claim wizard.",
