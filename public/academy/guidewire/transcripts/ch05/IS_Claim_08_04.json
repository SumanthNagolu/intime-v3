  "full_text": "Welcome to the Indemnity Exposure demonstration. Eileen Lang is still working on the Georgetown Roofing claim for Kin Chung. Eileen has an open activity related to the Indemnity Exposure, which is to get Kin's wage statement and tax status. She has contacted Georgetown Roofing's HR department. By the next day, they have provided an electronic copy of Kin's information. So Eileen marks the activity complete. Then she navigates to the Indemnity Exposure Demonstration. She has provided an electronic copy of the Indemnity Exposure to add the information she has received. First, she adds information about the work time Kin is missing. Kin is off work and will be for some time. Kin's medical time off work began on the day of the incident, and it is not yet known when he will be able to return. Yesterday, the day of the incident, was the last day Kin worked. Georgetown Roofing has stated that Kin will be paid for that last day. Eileen is finished entering the work status, so she clicks OK to save it. A modified duty arrangement is not available, so Kin will not return to work until he is sufficiently recovered to do his normal job. But the doctor's expectation is that he will make a full recovery and will be able to return to work until he is sufficiently recovered. In the benefits tab, he will return to his usual job. On the benefits tab, Eileen calculates the workers' compensation payment Kin will receive. Kin makes $880 per week. Since there will be no period of modified duty, his post-injury wage will also be $880 per week. Eileen clicks Update to save her work and calculate the weekly compensation rate. Kin is temporarily disabled, he will return to work, but the disability is total, he cannot work even a modified duty until he is fully recovered. Looking at the temporary total disability section of the benefits card, Eileen sees that Kin will receive a weekly payment of $586.67. This concludes the indemnity exposure simulation. This concludes the indemnity exposure simulation.",
