  "full_text": "Welcome to the demonstration of compensability parameters, ICD codes, and user settings. This account has been set to open to the administration page. This account has been set to open to the administration page. So we navigate to business settings. Then expand WC parameters. And open the compensability parameters screen. Let's have a look at the compensability parameters screen for Florida. First, notice the effective date and the expiration date. Any loss that occurs within that range will be processed using these parameters. If benefit payment implies acceptance is set to yes, then when a payment is made, ClaimCenter displays a validation error that says that making a payment before compensability is determined implies acceptance. If it is set to no, then ClaimCenter asks you to confirm the transaction. There are three denial period formulas, X days after loss date, X days after notification date, and the greater of the two. This sets the number of days the insurer must approve or deny the claim. Depending on which you choose, you must set the target number of days and the days to include, business days or calendar days. Now, let's look at the ICD code screen. Open the body system picker. Here you can search for ICD codes related to a specific systemic cause. Let's look at external causes of morbidity. When we click search. This screen appears, showing all codes associated with external causes of damage. These codes can be very specific. Here, for example, is a code representing being hit by a roller skater while walking. If we click it. A page is displayed showing the details stored in ClaimCenter, including translations. Here, if we click the code number again. A pop-up window appears, showing the search results for this code on the ICD-10 data page. We can click the label. We see this page, showing the full details of the code, its meaning, and its history. We can see that this code was introduced to ICD-10 in 2016, and that the code is used to describe the circumstances that caused an injury, and not the injury itself. Let's close this pop-up and return to ClaimCenter. Enter the main ICD code reference page. Let's search for a different kind of code. This category is related to the one we were just looking at. Where that one described causes of injury, this describes the specific injury itself. We'll search for a specific family of codes, S00. When we execute this search. The results show a large number of very specific possible head injuries that can arise from external causes. Let's examine the most general, superficial injury of head. As an administrator, we can edit the details. As you see, several details cannot be edited, but the code number, description, and body system may be changed. Probably the most useful feature of this edit page, however, is the ability to add translations of the description into some of the most commonly used languages. Editing ICD codes can have unexpected results on existing claims, and should only be done by an expert. So we will cancel out of the edit page. Returning now to the main code reference screen. We can add new codes to the database. Here you can add all the details that were editable on the edit code screen. We have none to add, as this also should be done by an expert. Finally, we will examine the capabilities of user settings. To set the stage, we will need another user. So we will log in as Laura James. Laura is an adjuster with general responsibilities. We will take a look at the claims screen of Laura's desktop page. The claims are not sortable by claimant. When we click the header, nothing happens, and there are no up-down arrowheads present. Now let's change a user setting. To do this, we will log out as Lana James. To change user settings. We log in again as the system administrator. We'll navigate to Lana James' profile once again. Now, we will change a user setting for Lana. Specifically, we will change the loss type she works with from none, which makes her a generalist, to workers compensation. Now, to check the results of the change, we log out as the system administrator. And log back in as Laura James. Once again, we navigate to her desktop claims screen. The column header which previously read claimant now reads injured worker, and it contains up and down sorting arrows. If we click the down arrowhead. The claims are sorted by the name of the injured worker, in reverse alphabetical order. This concludes the demonstration of compensability parameters, ICD codes, and user setting. So, the                 of the                                     of the ",
