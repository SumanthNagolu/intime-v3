  "full_text": "Welcome to the Reserve Lines Demonstration. In this demonstration, Eileen Lange adds ClaimCost and ClaimExpense Reserve Lines to the Eleanor McKenzie claim. Eileen enters her username and her password and logs into ClaimCenter. She expands the Claims menu and enters the claim number for the Paul Salah claim against TR Gromit. She navigates to the Financial Screen. Here, Eileen sees that there are two sets of reserves already created, on for each of the two exposures. Each reserve line maps to a single exposure. $17,000 has been set aside for this claim. These reserve lines tell the story of the claim from a financial angle. The high amount set aside for claim cost on the Medical Details Exposure, plus the expense reserve line for a nurse case manager, suggest a serious injury. Meanwhile, the indemnity exposure tells another part of the story. We see Claim Cost Reserve Lines for Temporary Total Disability and Vocational, which suggest that Paul, the injured worker, will return to work before he is fully recovered, and do some other job for which he will require training. Because that job pays less than Paul's regular job, a reserve line has been created for supplemental earnings. Now, Eileen needs to create some reserve lines for Eleanor McKenzie's claim. She navigates to the claim. And to its Financial Summary page. No reserves have been set so far. Eileen will create the preliminary reserve lines for the claim. Eileen really doesn't know much about Eleanor's work status yet, though she is sure that Eleanor will miss at least some work. But she does know that Eleanor's symptoms are suggestive of a concussion, so she sets aside some funds on that basis. Claim Center has already created exposures. Eileen adds reserve lines to the Medical Details Exposure. The cost type for this reserve line Is claimed cost, that is, money used for indemnifying the injured party. And the cost category Is for a medical examination Eileen knows that in a case like this an MRI will probably be required. Between that and the doctor's fees, she sets aside $5,000 as a reserve line. Based on her knowledge and experience, Eileen decides to add a second reserve line to the Medical Details Exposure. Because of the nature of the injury And the risks associated with a concussion. Eileen decides to add reserves For an A and O, adjusting another expense. In particular, Eileen decides to To budget for a nurse case manager. She sets aside $500 to cover this expense. Finally, Eileen saves her work. Returning to the Financial Summary Screen Eileen sees that the remaining reserves and net total incurred are both $5,500. Drilling down on a Single Reserve Line Eileen sees that the status of the reserve line is submitting. This means that no approval is required, Because the reserve is within Eileen's authority limit as an adjuster. This concludes the demonstration of reserve line.",
