  "full_text": "Welcome to the assignment demonstration. In this demonstration I will create and assign two workers compensation claims. I begin by logging in as an administrator. I enter my credentials. And click login. To better understand this demonstration. I will navigate to the administration tab. And from users and security. Select groups. In the group name field, I type comp. And click the search button. There are two workers comp groups. The first team, A, deals with medical only claims. While team B, deals with claims involving indemnity, such as lost work time. That was all I needed to know for this demonstration. So I log out as the system administrator. So I log out as the system administrator. And as Eileen Lang. And adjuster. I log in to create two workers compensation claims. From the claim menu. I select new claim. In the organization name field. I enter L-E-N-N. And I click search. The only record that is found is a workers compensation policy for Lenar construction. This claim refers to a minor accident. Which occurred last Monday. I click next to enter contact details. The accident occurred. At Lenar's headquarters on Yount Lane. The accident was reported. By Jennifer Albee. Who is an employee. Of Lenar construction. The injured worker is not in our records. So I enter them as a new person. The worker's first name is Pat. And their last name is Murphy. And their social security number is 838-38-3838. I click update. And next. Pat received an electrical shock while using the toaster in the office break room. The incident occurred. The incident occurred in the office.           The incident occurred in the office. The incident occurred in the office. The incident occurred in the office.   The incident occurred in the office. The incident occurred in the office. The incident occurred in the office. The incident occurred in the office.   ! The incident occurred in the office of the incident.  The severity of the injury was minor. Pat was not killed by the shock. For the source of the injury I select miscellaneous causes, as none of the more specific categories really fits. The injury is of a specific type. Which is electric shock. The area of the body affected is the upper extremities. More specifically, Pat's hands and wrists. Both hands were involved. So I select both here. Medical attention was required by the company, to verify that no worse injury had been incurred. But Pat lost no significant amount of work time. I move on to the final page of the wizard, which is assignment. I click finish and claim center automatically assigns the claim. Because there was no loss of work time, the claim has been successfully created and assigned to adjuster Warren Motley of Team A, which as you recall works with medical only claims. Now I will create the second worker's compensation claim. This claim also relates to Lenar construction. So when I click select, the same policy appears as for the first claim. This claim is for an ongoing condition, but it is first being reported today. I click next to start entering information about the claim. Once again, the injury has occurred at Lenar's Yout Lane HQ. And the injury was reported by Jennifer Albee. Who is a particularly conscientious employee of Lenar construction. The injured employee, once again, is not in our files. So I will add them. The injured employee is named Terry. With last name, Pacek. I add Terry's social security number. Then click update. And next, to enter the main claim details. Terry has been experiencing pain and numbness in the wrists and hands while typing. The injury has occurred on the job, where Terry spends much of the day at the keyboard. Though the pain has been building over time. It has recently gotten bad enough that, today, Terry made a formal report of injury to Jennifer. Of course. This took place at Lenar's headquarters. The injury is not fatal. In fact, it is considered a minor injury. The cause of the injury is listed as rubbed or abraded by. And the detailed injury type is strain. The area of the body is the upper extremities while the specific body parts are the wrists and hands for both hands and both wrists on both sides. Medical attention will be required with physical therapy and possible surgery. There will be time lost from work. I click next to move to the assign and finish screen. And, using the default of automated assignment, I click finish. The claim has been submitted and assigned to Candace Payne of Team B, which, you recall, deals with indemnity claims. Now I will search for the first claim I created. While I do know the claimant's name, I will search for any party involved. Whose last name is Murphy? When I click search, the claim I created appears. I click the claim number to navigate to the claim. On the status page, I see that the segment is workers' comp, med only, which matches the assignment to team. There is also an exposure for medical details. Now let's look at the other claim I created. Returning to the claim search page, I enter the last name Tachek and click search. Once again, I click the claim number to navigate to the claim and select the status page. Here I see that the claim segment is workers' comp, indemnity, which matches the assignment to team B. In addition, there are both medical details and indemnity exposures. Finally, I will assign this claim to myself for use in further demonstrations. From the actions menu, I select assign claim. On the select from list, field, I select my own name. Note that Eileen Lang is the only name from team A visible. This is because the claim is currently assigned to team B, so only team B adjusters are visible. Eileen Lang is visible, despite being a member of team A, because she is a currently logged in user and has the correct privileges to own a claim. I click assign. The adjuster for this claim is now Eileen Lang, comp, team A. This concludes the demonstration of claim assign.       so the plan of claiming B, so the plan of claiming B, so the plan of claiming B,                ",
