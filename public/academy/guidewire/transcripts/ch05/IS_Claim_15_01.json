  "full_text": "Welcome to the demonstration of subrogation. In this demonstration, Succeed Insurance receives and processes information that suggests subrogation is appropriate for the Bob Tyre slash Lennar construction claim. Gerald Ikes logs into ClaimCenter. He has learned that Lennar suspects that the accident was caused by a failure of the ladder that Mr. Tyre was using. They have made that conclusion based on eyewitness accounts, and after talking with Mr. Tyre, Gerald navigates to the claim. And to its lost details screen. Because the cause of injury on the claim was fall, slip, or trip injury, ClaimCenter placed the claim in subrogation review status. This doesn't mean it is subject to subrogation, but it does mean there is a likelihood that it could be. Gerald opens the subrogation screen. Gerald is an adjuster, and as such, in the base application, cannot own a subrogation. But he can add a note that explains why this claim may be a candidate for subrogation. He adds a note explaining that ladder failure might be the cause of Mr. Tyre's fall. Returning to the general card. Gerald refers the claim to subrogation. He adds a note to the subrogation specialist. He adds a note to the claim to the claim. Informing them that, based on information received from Lennar Construction. This claim is a candidate for subrogation. Then he clicks Update to refer the claim for subrogation. The subrogation has been assigned by default to Gerald, so he clicks Assign. The base configuration of ClaimCenter has no defined subrogation team. So Gerald assigns the subrogation to Warren Motley. Warren is Gerald's supervisor and, for purposes of this demo, the subrogation specialist. Clicking Assign completes the assignment process. Gerald knows that Succeed Insurance notifies third parties of subrogation interest. So he creates a reminder activity to send them a letter. Gerald does not yet have the document ready to send or to attach to the activity, so he creates the activity with the default values. Now that the subrogation has been assigned. And the reminder activity has been created. We can take a look at what the subrogation specialist sees. Warren Motley enters his username and password. And logs into ClaimCenter. On his desktop, Warren sees that a claim for subrogation has been assigned to him. Noting that the subrogation status is in review, he navigates to the claim. Warren reads the note from the adjuster, and agrees that this claim should be subject to subrogation. In a normal sequence of events, the subrogation specialist will investigate and decide whether or not to pursue the subrogation. This propcus could be short, or could take a long time. For this demonstration, we will suppose that some time has passed before Warren begins recording the subrogation information. The first that he does is set the fault status. It is succeeds position that A&C latter company bears the responsibility for the accident. The subrogation is no longer in review. So Warren sets the subrogation status to open. Next, Warren adds the other party who is at fault. A&C is a new company, in the sense that it is not present in the contact manager address book. So Warren will add them to the claim as related to this claim only. Warren records the name of the latter company. As well as its street address. Warren only needs to type the first part of the city name. Warren clicks OK to save the new party. And clicks Update to save the subrogation data. And clicks Responsible Parties. And, on the Responsible Parties screen, selects the Financials card. Here he sees that the amount Succeed expects to recover from A&C latter is $2,906.25. Again, some time passes, and Succeed negotiates with A&C latter. From the Actions menu. Warren selects New Transaction, Other, Recovery. A recovery of $1,050 has been agreed upon, and A&C has issued a payment. Warren records the payment. The payer is A&C latter company. Any transaction must be recorded against a reserve line. Which is Medical Details, Claim Costs Slash Medical. There are several kinds of recovery transaction. From the list, Warren selects Subrogation. Finally, Warren enters the amount of the transaction, $1,050. When he clicks Update. He sees that the recovery transaction was created in the amount of $1,050. This concludes the demonstration of subrogation. So, you know, the plan of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of the transaction of ",
