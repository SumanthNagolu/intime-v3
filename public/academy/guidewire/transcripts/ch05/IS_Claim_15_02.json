  "full_text": "Welcome to the demonstration of litigation in ClaimCenter for workers compensation. In this demonstration we will create a new legal matter and add a planned activity to it. We begin by navigating to the litigation screen. On this screen, we will create a new legal matter. We enter a brief but descriptive name for the legal issue. Next, we enter details about the plaintiff. This is a new person to the claim file. We enter the plaintiff's first name, Lin. And her last name, Chang. Ms. Jang's home phone number is 213-555-8392. Next, we enter Ms. Chynig's relationship to the deceased worker. The related contacts list is empty. We will add one. The relationship is with Terry Chiang, Ms. Jang's spouse. Since Terry Chiang obviously cannot act as a primary contact, Ms. Chiang will act as the primary contact for Terry. This finishes the addition of Lin Chiang to the new legal matter. The defendant in this matter will be Georgetown Roofing. We also enter the case or docket number. We also enter the case or docket number, in this case IMCA underscore docket underscore 2022 underscore 72. Next, we enter Ms. Jang's legal representative. She is being legally represented by an attorney named Kevin Graff. We will also enter Mr. Graff's legal license number. Mr. Graff specializes in workers' compensation law. And, we click Update to save the information about this attorney. The court in which the suit has been filed is the California State Court for Imperial County. The case is assigned to a courtroom and judge specializing in workers' compensation cases. The case was served on Georgetown Roofing without prior notice or demand for compensation. Kevin Graff is a junior partner in the venerable and respected law firm of Graff, SPI, and Sons. Their corporate offices are on Lethe Avenue. In the fashionable Armstrong district of the city of Imperial. This is, of course, a business address. The firm specializes in labor law, including workers' compensation cases. Our primary point of contact with the firm will be Mr. Graff. This is all the information we need about the firm, so we click Update to save, and return to the legal matter at hand. We are logged in as Candice Payne, so we select her as the owner of the matter. We are done with the basic creation of the Terry Cheung Ronfield death matter, so we click Update to save our work and return to the matters list. We have made arrangements with Georgetown Roofing to interview the workers who were witnesses to Terry Jang's fall in early March. We turn to the calendar view. Here we have a view of the scheduled activities for this month. There are none. We also have the option of viewing all activities associated with the matter, not only our own. The appointment is in early March, so we click the right arrow to advance the calendar one month. No activities are displayed for the first week of March. This is because the activity has not yet been created and assigned. To create the activity, we use the Actions menu. The activity type is interview, and the subtype is get a statement from witness. We enter a description of the purpose of the interview. Of course, we associate the activity with the matter at hand. The due date currently shows February 10th. We must change that, so we click the Calendar Picker button. The interview is on March 1st, so we advance the calendar to March. And double-click the date. This activity should be of high calendar importance. Jennifer Albee, the corporate counsel for Georgetown Roofing, will be the external owner for this activity. As with the matter, we will assign the activity to Candice Payne. We always save our work. This takes us to the work plan for the claim, where we see the activity we just created. Now we return to the Litigation screen. On the Matter screen we click My Calendar. Here, we see that the Get a Statement from Witness activity appears on the calendar for March 1st. If we click the item, the Detail pane for the activity is displayed. This concludes the demonstration of how Claims Center records legal matters.",
