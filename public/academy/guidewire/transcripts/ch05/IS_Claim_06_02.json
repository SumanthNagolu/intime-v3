  "full_text": "Andy Applegate is an adjuster doing some research on what data is available on a claim. From an operating system file window, he finds the ClaimCenter installation and drills down to build, dictionary, data. He opens index.html. From the opening page of index.html, Andy can see several views of the data entities and a list of type lists. He opens the data. Entities page. The opening page shows a list of the ClaimCenter entities on the left. Andy is looking for details of the claim entity, so he scrolls to where he can see the claim entity in the list. He clicks Claim to see the details of the claim entity. On the claim page, he can choose to navigate quickly to the fields, arrays, or unique keys for the claim entity. Since he is interested in seeing the relationship to activity, he selects the arrays link. In the arrays section of the claim entity, Andy sees the activities array. The text says that it is an array key for activity. That means that this array holds keys that point to all the activities that relate to a given claim. Andy clicks activity to open the activity entity page. The activity page, shows the same properties for activity. as the claim page did for the claim entity. There are links to the, fields, arrays, and unique keys. Andy is interested in the claim attribute, so he scrolls down the fields list to find it. The claim attribute is a foreign key back to the claim entity. So, for each activity associated with a claim, there is a pointer back to that specific claim. Andy navigates back to the claim entity. Andy navigates back to the claim entity and looks at the arrays list again. He could click either the browser back button, or the link to claim from the claim attribute. Using the back button takes him back to the arrays list on the claim. The claim link would take him to the top of the claim entity. From the claim entity array list, Andy scrolls to find the contacts attribute. Notice that, although the name is contacts, the array key is for claim contact. Remember that each claim may have multiple claim contacts. Andy opens the claim contact entity. He then scrolls down to find the claim attribute. He finds the claim attribute which is a foreign key, or pointer, back to the owning claim for this claim contact. Recall that each claim contact is related to one claim. Next, Andy scrolls to find the contact attribute. The contact attribute is a foreign key to contact. Remember that claim contact is what keeps track of each contact that has a relationship with a claim. Andy navigates to the contact entity. On the contact entity, Andy notices that there is a list of subtypes for contact, like company, person, and place. He also sees that the subtypes have their own subtypes. For example, company has company vendor which is further subtyped to auto repair shop, auto towing agency, and so on. Person has its own set of subtypes, including adjudicator, person vendor, and user contact. He clicks on the link for the person subtype. He notices a few of the fields, like date of birth, first, name, and last name, which seem standard information for a person. He navigates back to the claim entity. This ends the examining the data dictionary demonstration.
