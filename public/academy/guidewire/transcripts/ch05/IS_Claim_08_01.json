In the financials section, she can view the sum total reserves, payments, and recoveries associated with the medical details exposure. The coding section shows the details of how the exposure was segmented.

The medical diagnosis section is always blank at first. A list will appear here showing the coded medical diagnoses provided by the injured workers medical team. There is also a list of activities specifically related to this exposure. In the base application, two activities are automatically generated upon creation of a medical details exposure, making contact with a medical provider, and getting the initial medical report. Of course, these activities are only part of the work plan for the whole claim. The base configuration has generated five additional activities, one associated with the indemnity exposure, and the other four associated with the claim itself. This concludes the medical details exposure demonstration.",
