  "full_text": "Part of Sue's job as a supervisor is to make sure that claims are processed as quickly as possible. Sometimes, she needs to reassign a claim from one adjuster to another, because of the adjuster's workload or other circumstances. She clicks the Team tab to see the workloads of her team members. The summary screen shows aggregated counts of the work assigned to her team. If she supervised multiple teams, it would show them all. The summary shows that her team has 10 open claims. five of which are flagged. She clicks the team in the left pane to see a list of her team members and their relative workloads. Sue now has a view of the relative workload of each of the adjusters on her team. The top half of the screen shows the information in a tabular format, and a graphical view is provided in the lower half of the screen. She notices that Andy Applegate has many open claims, and that his claim weight is higher than any other adjuster. He also has a few overdue activities. She expands the group so she can select any individual adjuster. Because of what she saw on the summary screen, she selects Andy Applegate to see the details of his workload. Sue decides to reassign the bill. Sue decides to reassign the bill Kinman claim to Dan Henson to reduce Andy's workload. She selects the bill Kinman claim by clicking the checkbox to the left of the claim. Then she clicks, Assign. On the Assign screen, she selects Dan Henson from the Select from List Assignment drop-down. And clicks Assign. After Sue Reassign. After Sue Reassigns the Kinman claim, she clicks, Auto 1, Team A, again to view the entire team. The Team Claim screen shows all of the open claims owned by her group. She sees that the Kinman claim is now assigned to Dan. Sue clicks the claim number to look at the claim details. She selects the work plan to look at the activities on this claim. The review coverage in question activity is now assigned to Dan. It was reassigned with the claim. Next, Sue looks at the exposures. She sees that, just like the activities, the exposures for this claim were also reassigned to Dan. She is done for now, so Sue logs out of Claim Center. This ends the supervisor reassign a claim demonstration.",
