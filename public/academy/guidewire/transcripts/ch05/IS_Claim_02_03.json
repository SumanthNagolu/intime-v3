  "full_text": "Sue Smith is a supervisor with Succeed Insurance. In this demonstration, she checks for, escalated activities and finds that there is at least one item she needs to look at more closely. Sue Logs into ClaimCenter. As a supervisor, she regularly checks for activities that may have been, escalated. The first thing she does this morning is to look at her assigned activities. She sees that the review and approve quote activity on the Farley claim has been escalated. To investigate, she opens the activity. She sees on the activity, detail, that the activity relates to the auto body repairs being done by Joe's, auto body shop. She clicks on the link to see the related service. On the services detail page, she sees that someone has already approved the quote, since it has a status of approved, and the next action is to follow up with the vendor. Sue wonders when it was approved, since she has an escalated activity to approve it. She checks the history of the service. She sees in the history, that Andy recently approved the quote. Since the quote has been approved, the escalated activity is no longer needed. Sue marks the activity complete. Now that she has taken care of that activity, she wants to see if there is anything else that needs her attention. She navigates to the team summary to check her team status. She notices that within the groups she supervises, there are 10 open claims and 6 flagged claims. Since she only has one team, she clicks, auto 1, team, A, to see some details. She notes that, Andy Applegate, has flagged claims, so she decides to take a look at those first. Sue expands the team list. She selects Andy Applegate. As she looks at the list of his claims, she notices that one of the claims is for Ray Newton. Because she sees that this claim is flagged, she decides to take a closer look. On the summary page, Sue checks the top section to see if anything stands out. The number of days open is reasonable and the financials look okay. She notes that there are several high risk, indicators. She hovers the cursor over the flag icon to see details about the flag. She sees that there is a high priority activity that is overdue. She looks at the claim, work plan for more details. She sees that one of the overdue activities is to put the third party on notice of subrogation interest. Sue thinks that she probably needs to give Andy a call to see if there is anything she can do to help, but decides to do a little research first. She navigates back to the claim summary. Although notes are shown on the summary page, only the five latest notes display there. There is a notes page which shows all of the claim notes in one place. Sue opens the notes page. She sees that Andy has contacted the other insurance company and is waiting for a response. He needs to follow up with a letter of subrogation interest. Sue will remind him of that later. To find out more about this claim, she opens history. On the history screen, Sue sees when Andy first viewed the claim and when the system flagged the claim for subrogation. Now that she has more information about the history of the claim, she decides it's time to call Andy to see if there is anything she can help with on this claim. This is the end of the check escalated activities demonstration.",
