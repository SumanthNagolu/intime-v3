  "full_text": "As a Claim Supervisor, Sue has many responsibilities. In addition to handling her own assigned tasks, she also monitors her team's workload and performance. Sue logs into ClaimCenter. Initially, she sees the activities screen just as an adjuster does. As a supervisor, she has an additional tab to help manage her team. The team screens hold information about the groups that the supervisor is responsible for. The My Groups, Summary view shows the aggregate counts for claims and other entities that are assigned to the groups. Sue supervises. Notice that she supervises a single group. Sue can also use the Team Summary to take a closer look at the details of what is assigned to her group. This screen shows Sue's workload and aggregate status of the items assigned to adjusters in her group. The table at the top shows the counts of objects assigned to each team member by status. The bottom half of the screen provides a graphical view of each team member's workload. Everything for the team looks fine for now, so Sue navigates back to her desktop to see the activities that she may need to address. Here are the review activities assigned to Sue. This is the end of the supervisor basics demonstration.
