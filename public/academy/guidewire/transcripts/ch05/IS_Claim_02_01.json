  "full_text": "In this demonstration, Ida Belt, a customer service representative, receives calls from a vendor and two clients asking her to check on something specific about a claim in which they have an interest. Ida uses the advanced claim search capability in ClaimCenter to find the claims that are of interest to the callers. As usual, Ida logs into ClaimCenter. She takes a call from AB Garage. Mr. Smith at the garage needs to know which adjuster is assigned to the callers. He doesn't have the claim number, but has the car license plate number, and remembers that the claimant's first name is Ray. She accesses the search menu. She selects Advanced Search. She enters Ray as the first name. She also enters the license plate number for the search. She clicks Search. She scrolls down the page to see the search results. Ida sees the claim she is looking for. And that the adjuster is Andy Applegate. After reviewing the results, she scrolls back up to the top of the page. Next, Ida gets a call from Mr. Albertson. He is looking for information on his claim, but the only thing he knows is that he received a check for $1,500. Ida clicks Checks in the Search Tab's sidebar. She enters part of Mr. Albertson's name. The check search criteria uses a range of values for the amount. She enters $1,500 as the from amount, because that was the amount of the check. She enters the same amount for the to amount. She doesn't know when the check was issued or created, so she chooses any for the creation date. She clicks Search. The results return Mr. Albertson's claim. She opens the claim to see the details. Ida tells Mr. Albertson his claim number, and that the adjuster is William Dufresne. Next, Ida gets a call from Mr. Farley. He hasn't heard from his adjuster and needs to talk to him urgently. Ida starts another search. She selects Advanced Search in the Search Tab's sidebar. Ida uses the first few characters of Mr. Farley's last name for the search. She clicks Search. The search returns one claim from Mr. Farley, so Ida opens it. Ida verifies the claims lost date with Mr. Farley, and tells him that the adjuster is Andy Applegate. Mr. Farley is upset that he has not heard from the adjuster, so Ida uses the Actions menu to create a new general reminder activity for Andy to call Mr. Farley. She enters a new subject, ensure it needs a call back. She sets the due date as today. She sets the escalation date as today. Ida also sets the priority to urgent. Then she saves the new activity. Ida verifies that the new urgent activity is created. She tells Mr. Farley that Mr. Applegate should be calling him soon. Ida is done for the day, so she logs out of Claim Center. This ends the claim search and ad activity demonstration. DEMONSTRATION   DEMONSTRATION        DEMONSTRATION               DEMONSTRATION    DEMONSTRATION ",
