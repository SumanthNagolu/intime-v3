  "full_text": "This demonstration shows how ClaimCenter constrains payments using financial holds based on maturity level, unverified policy, and coverage in question. In the first scenario of the demonstration, claims adjuster Andy Applegate will attempt to issue a payment for an exposure that has not reached the ability to pay validation level. Andy logs into ClaimCenter. In the Desk Claims screen, Andy locates the ClaimCenter. ClaimCenter. He opens it. He navigates to the Financials Summary screen to examine the Claim Financials. Notice that the net total incurred for the claim is $19,500. Andy needs to issue a payment against the third-party bodily injury exposure for ClaimCenter. He locates the medical reserve line under the exposure and clicks the menu button. He selects Create Check from the Options menu. An error is raised because the bodily injury exposure is not at validation level ability to pay. The specific validation errors display in the validation results worksheet in the lower half of the screen. Andy doesn't know enough about the exposure to correct the error, so he clears the validation results and moves on. The next part of the demonstration shows what happens when a policy becomes unverified, and how that impacts payments. The policy is changed in ClaimCenter to update a limit. Andy starts by going to his desktop view. He navigates to his claims. He locates the Robert Farley claim in the list and opens it. To force the policy into an unverified state, he needs to change something on the policy. First, he navigates to the policy. Notice that the policy is in force from May 9, 2018, until May 8, 2019. Also notice that the verified policy field is set to yes, indicating that the claims policy snapshot was retrieved from the policy system of record when the claim was created. Andy navigates to the policy's vehicle information. He wants to change the incident limit on the vehicle, so he puts the screen in edit mode. Note that as soon as he attempts to edit the policy, ClaimCenter displays a warning message that the policy will be marked unverified. He clicks OK to continue the edit. And he locates the incident limit for the collision coverage in the coverages section of the screen. And changes the limit to $30,000. He saves the change. And returns to the policy general screen. When Andy edited the policy, it was flagged as unverified. Notice that the verified policy field is now set to no. Next Andy navigates to the financials summary screen to create a check. He locates the auto body reserve line for the first party vehicle collision exposure for claimant Robert Farley, and clicks on the menu button. He selects the menu option Create Check. The first step of the check wizard displays. And he accepts this information and continues to the payment step. On the payment information step, the exposure and reserve line are also set automatically from the financial summary. Andy enters the payment amount in the existing line item. He keeps the default values for the payment type and eroding fields. Notice that after the payment amount is entered, the exposure line is updated with additional information. And he continues to the final check wizard step. There are no special instructions, so he clicks the finish button to create the check. An unverified policy validation error is generated, blocking creation of the check. Andy cancels the check wizard. And clicks OK on the warning message to exit and cancel the changes. He navigates back to the policy screen. Recall that the policy is unverified because it was edited. This results in a financial hold, preventing payments from being made. Andy refreshes the policy to replace the edited version with a fresh copy from the policy system. On the policy comparison screen, the current policy column shows the changes made to the policy, and the new policy column shows the original policy as it was retrieved from the policy system. Andy expands the nodes for the policy's vehicle information, and he can see the difference in the collision incident limit and the verified status of the current and new policy. He clicks the finish button to complete the refresh. Now the policy is verified again. In the final scenario, we will continue with the Robert Farley claim and observe how a coverage in question condition can be caused by changing the claims date of loss to a date outside of the effective dates for the policy. Note again that the policy is in effect from May 9, 2018, until May 8, 2019. Andy navigates to the loss details screen. Now he will change the loss date of the claim to be outside of the effective dates of the policy. He puts the loss details screen in edit mode. He enters a loss date that is before the policy's effective date. And clicks the update button. A warning message displays at the top of the screen indicating that the policy will become unverified as a result of the change. And he clicks the update button again to complete the date change. Notice the new icon in the claim information bar. This indicates that coverage is in question for the claim. Next, Andy will look at the claim's status information by clicking the summary menu link. And then the status link. Notice that coverage in question is set on the claim, and that the reason is that the loss date is before the policy effective date. Andy puts the screen in edit mode to turn the coverage in question indicator off. The coverage in question field is not editable, because Andy does not have the permission necessary to change the value. He cancels the edit. He returns to the loss details screen to set the loss date back within the policy effective dates. He puts the screen into edit mode. And changes the loss date to fall within the policy effective dates. He saves the change. Notice that the coverage in question icon still displays in the claim information bar. He navigates to the claim status screen again to check the coverage in question value. Notice that the coverage in question status indicator is still in place. He returns to the loss details screen. And logs out of claim center. Andy's supervisor is Sue Smith. She logs in to remove the coverage in question flag from the claim. Sue's default view is the desktop activities screen. To search for the Robert Farley claim, she clicks on the menu button of the search tab. And selects first claims, and then simple search from the menu. She types the first few letters of the insured's last name into the search criteria, and clicks the search button. The Robert Farley claim is returned in the search results, and she opens it. She navigates to the claim status screen. And after confirming the coverage in question setting on the claim, puts the screen in edit mode. She sets the value of the coverage in question flag to no. And saves the change. Notice that after updating the claim, the coverage in question icon is no longer displayed in the claim information bar, and the coverage in question indicator has been reset. Sue logs out of claim center. This is the end of the financial holds demonstration.
