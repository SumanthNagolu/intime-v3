  "full_text": "This demonstration is more of a tour of an existing claim than a demonstration. It shows where and how entities are manifested in the user interface. It reinforces the data model concepts with concrete examples of how those entities are used. Andy Applegate is an adjuster doing some research on a claim. He logs into ClaimCenter. On his desktop, there are four claims. Andy selects the Ray Newton claim. In the Loss Details section you can see the Loss Date, Notice Date, Loss Location, and the Description of the Loss. These are all aspects of the overall claim. Andy now wants to see more details about the loss. On the left side of the page, the loss details pertain to the overall claim. In addition to the fields on the summary, this section shows the Fault Rating, Weather Conditions, Date of Loss, Jurisdiction and and so on. Next, Andy looks at the incidents on this claim. He sees that there are two vehicle incidents and two injury incidents. The vehicle incidents are the Mazda and Saturn, and the injury incidents are for Stan Newton and Bo Simpson. He examines the Mazda incident. On the vehicle incident page, he can see details about the Mazda. It shows the year, make, and model of the car, along with other vehicle specific information. Remember that incident. Remember that incident is subtyped, and that other incident types show other information. Andy returns to, the Loss Details screen. Next, Andy looks at the Stan Newton injury incident. On the injury incident page, Andy sees the details of the injury. It shows things like severity, injury type, treatment type, primary doctor, and so on. Although this is also an incident incident, the data captured for the incident, the data captured for this incident is very different than the data captured for a vehicle incident. Next, Andy looks at some contact information. Andy sees that there is a list of contacts at the top of the page. Some of them are persons, while others are vendors. Each of them has at least one role assigned. The role describes the contacts' relationship to the claim, which is captured in the claim contact entity. They could be a claimant, a witness, a witness, a third party, an injured party, and so on. Andy looks at the contact details of Stan Newton. Stan Newton has several roles on this claim. He is a claimant, a covered party, a driver, and an injured party. At the bottom of the screen, there is a section that shows the detailed information about the contact. There is the full name, which is a composite of the first and last names, along with other bits of information about Stan. There are also fields to capture the driver's license number and state. This information is from the contact entity. Andy examines Mike's, Auto Detailing Shop, which is a service vendor. Mike's, Auto Detailing Shop has only one role on the claim, the role of service vendor. The contact details are very different from the details for Stan. The contact details are different because a vendor is a subtype of contact, just like person is a subtype of contact. Each subtype has its own set of attributes. Notice the attributes don't include first name or last name, but rather the name of the business. Another difference is that the vendor information does not include a driver's license number, or state. Next, Andy looks at the exposure on this claim. As we saw earlier, there are four incidents on this claim, two vehicle incidents and two injury incidents. In this case, we have one exposure for each incident, although we could have more than one exposure for each incident. Andy looks at the vehicle exposure for Ray Newton. This exposure is for collision coverage on the Saturn, which means that this exposure is related to the Saturn incident. The claimant is the insured, Ray Newton. Remember that Ray is listed on the parties involved as a claimant, along with other roles. The validation level for this exposure is at ability to pay, which means that the information on this exposure is sufficient for payment. Andy looks at the work plan, or activities for this claim. The work plan shows all the activities that relate to this claim. There is a drop-down where the user can filter which activities are displayed, but the default is all open activities. Andy opens the, Get Vehicle Inspected activity, which is related to the first-party vehicle exposure. The activity details display in a worksheet view in the lower third of the screen. Notice that this activity is related to the first-party vehicle, Ray Newton exposure. It is a reminder to Andy to have the vehicle inspected. This activity is related to the exposure entity. Andy closes the activity worksheet. That last activity was related to an exposure. Now Andy looks at the call witness activity. The activity, call witness, is related to the claim. It is not specific to any exposure, but, rather applies to the entire claim. The witness saw the accident, which is the overall claim, not a specific vehicle. Andy closes the activity worksheet. And opens the financial screen. The financial summary page shows the overall status of the financials for this claim. First notice that the top of the page shows the claim level totals. Each exposure has reserve lines under claim cost and expense. Those are the multiple reserve lines on a claim and exposures. In the claim financial transactions screen, Andy can also look at the transactions that make up the financial summary. The default list of transactions includes all types of transactions. The drop-down list in the upper right corner of the page contains additional filters to change the transaction view. Andy selects reserves to restrict the list to only reserve transactions. The list now shows all the transactions that have been applied to the reserve lines. These transactions are maintained in the transaction entity. The total of the submitted, non-pending transactions is the total incurred for the claim. Andy goes back to look at all the transactions. The transaction list now contains a mix of reserves and payments. As before, the total of the reserves is the total incurred. The total of the payments will be the total amount paid for the claim to date. These are payment transactions and not necessarily the number of checks submitted. Remember, a check may contain multiple payments. Next, Andy looks at the checks. Next, Andy looks at the checks. There has been only one check issued against this claim. The gross amount of the check is $2,000. Andy clicks the check number to see the details of the check. The net amount of this check is $1,900. This is because when the check was submitted, the adjuster applied a deduction for backup withholding. Applying a deduction is one of the options available when creating a check. At the bottom of the screen is the payments section. There are multiple payment transactions on this one check. The check is stored in the check entity, and may be related to multiple transactions. In this case, there are payments for the collision coverage, as well as multiple medical payments. The sum of all the payments is the gross amount of the check. Remember that in Claim Center, a check is a payment. It may be a physical check, or an electronic funds transfer. Andy logs out of Claim Center. This ends the entities in the user interface demonstration. D- D- D-                       D-   D-                           situation.",
