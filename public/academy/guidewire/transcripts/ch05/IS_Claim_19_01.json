  "full_text": "Vendor services help identify the right vendors for a given incident or a claim. Adjusters can search for and assign work or services to a specific vendor. Services can be added to a claim during claim intake or later. Andy has been in touch with Mr. Williams about his claim. Mr. Williams told Andy that he is using Bill's quick auto repair for towing and repair of his truck. Andy logs into ClaimCenter. He locates and opens Mr. Williams's claim. He starts by using the Actions menu and selecting New Service. This service is for towing Mr. Williams's truck, so the service is related to the Ford XLT. He clicks Add to add the service. This service is for towing. And he clicks OK to accept towing as the service to perform. Since it is towing, he doesn't need or want to quote first. He just wants the service completed. To select a vendor for the towing service, he uses the drop down by the vendor name and selects Search. Andy adds San Mateo as the city for the search. Because San Mateo is one of the preloaded cities, ClaimCenter populates the state and zip code. The search is further restricted to only vendors who provide towing. He clicks Search. Bill's quick auto repair is one of the vendors returned in the search results. He selects Bill's quick auto repair. He adds additional instructions for the vendor to call Mr. Williams for towing details. Andy then selects the address for the service. The details on this service are complete. He is requesting towing service for the Ford XLT, without requiring a quote first. He also added instructions for the vendor, and provided the address for the service. Andy clicks Submit to create the service. Andy needs to create another service. This one will be for repair of Mr. Williams's truck. Just as before, he uses the Actions menu and selects New Service. Again, he relates the new service to the Ford XLT. And adds a service. This service is for auto body repair. He clicks OK to add the auto body repair service. Because of the scope of the repair, Andy wants to get and approve a quote, before the vendor performs the service. This time, Andy uses the drop-down list to select a vendor. Since Bill's has already been used on this claim, the vendor is a contact and therefore is available in the drop-down list. As he did before, Andy adds instructions for the vendor to call Mr. Williams to discuss the repairs. He selects the service address from the drop-down list. This time, he selects the location of the shop. Andy has entered everything he needs for this service. It's for auto body repair on the Ford XLT, and it's for quote and perform service. He will see a quote that needs to be approved before Bill's performs the service. He also added some instructions and selected the address where the service will be performed. Andy clicks Submit to create the service request. There are two service requests on this claim. The first one is for towing and the next action is to agree to perform service. When the vendor accepts the work, they will simply perform the service. The second service request is for a quote and perform service. The next action on this request is to agree to provide a quote. Once the vendor accepts the work, their first task is to provide a quote for the service requested. This is the end of the adding services demonstration.",
