  "full_text": "Roles and permissions help control what a user can and cannot do on a claim. In most cases, users are assigned roles, like customer service representative, adjuster, supervisor, and others which contain permissions specific to their jobs. Users may be assigned multiple roles which help keep specific permissions from being assigned to a wide group of users. For example, any adjuster can add activities or documents to closed claims. If the insurer decides to be a restrict those permissions, an administrator can assign them to a single role. Andy Applegate logs into ClaimCenter. Andy is going to work on the Bill Kinman claim, so he starts with a search. He enters Kinman as the last name and clicks search. Bill Kinman is a claimant on three claims. The first claim in the list is the only one where the claim is closed and he is the sole claimant. This is the claim Andy is looking for. There is an icon at the top of the screen and a status in the summary that shows the claim is closed. Now that he has the claim, Andy adds an activity as a reminder to send a letter to the claimant. On the new activity screen, he makes sure that the reminder activity is assigned to himself. The default values for the other details of the activity are fine, so he clicks update. Andy has also received a document confirming the claimant. The client has accepted the claim payments, so he adds the document to the claim. Andy enters the name of the document. He sets the status of the document to approved. And the document type to letter received. He reviews the fields for completeness. And clicks update to save the document reference. He opens the document screen. And sees the customer acceptance letter he just added to the claim. Since he is finished with this claim for now, he logs out of claim center. The administrator. Succeed Insurance has decided that there are too many adjusters who are adding activities and documents to claims that are closed. To address this problem, Succeed has asked the system administrator to remove that ability from all adjusters with the exception of Andy Applegate. The administrator. The administrator. Logs into claim center. The administrator goes to the administration section of claim center. And clicks users and security. The administrator is going to use roles to solve the issue of too many users creating activities and documents on closed claims. She starts by opening the adjuster role. The adjuster role includes the permissions create activities on closed claim. And create documents on closed claim. The administrator clicks edit to make changes to the permissions on the adjuster role. She selects create activities on closed claim. And create documents on closed claim. The administrator clicks remove. To remove the selected permissions from the role. She clicks update to save the changes. With those two permissions gone. Adjusters will no longer be allowed to create activities or documents on closed claims. The administrator logs out of claim center. To demonstrate the effect of the changes to the adjuster role. Andy Applegate logs into claim center. As before. He selects the bill Kinman claim. Remember the Kinman claim is closed. Andy selects the actions menu and sees that there are no activity or document options. This is because his role. Adjuster. No longer contains those permissions. Andy logs out of claim center. Remember that succeed insurance wants only Andy to be able to add documents and activities to closed claims. During the previous steps. The administrator removed those permissions from all adjusters. Now. She needs to somehow grant those permissions to Andy. The claim center administrator logs back in. She starts with the administration tab. And then. Users and security. The administrator is going to use roles to grant those closed claim permissions to Andy. She is going to add a role created specifically for creating activities and documents on closed claims. On the roles screen. She clicks add role. The administrator names the role. Closed claims. And then describes the purpose of the role. The next step is to choose which permissions will be assigned to this role. The first permission the administrator adds is. Create activities on closed claim. She adds the second permission. The second permission for this role is create documents on closed claim. The new role is named closed claims. It has two permissions assigned. Create activities on closed claim. And create documents on closed claim. The administrator clicks update to save the new closed claims role. The administrator verifies that the role closed claims is now included in the list of roles. Next. She needs to assign the closed claims role to Andy. The administrator searches for Andy by entering the first few letters of his user name and clicking search. She then clicks Andy Applegate in the search results. Because she is going to make changes to the roles Andy has. The administrator clicks edit. Currently Andy has two roles. Trusted for sensitive claims. And adjuster. The administrator clicks add to add the new role. She selects the new role. Closed claims. From the list. Andy now has three roles assigned. Trusted for sensitive claims. Adjuster. And closed claims. He inherits all the permissions from each of these three roles. The administrator clicks update to save the changes. And logs out of claim center. To verify that he has permission to create activities and documents on claims that are closed. Andy logs back into claim center. He opens the Bill Kinman claim. Which is closed. He clicks the actions menu. And sees that even on this closed claim. He can now create both activities and documents. Andy logs out of claim center. This is the end of the managing roles and permissions demonstration.",
