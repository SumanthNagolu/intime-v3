  "full_text": "As part of adjudication, an adjuster reviews the claims exposures to make decisions about damage. These decisions may include making payments for the claim. Chris is still logged into ClaimCenter. He selects the Mark Henderson claim. Chris needs to evaluate the cost of repairing Mr. Henderson's vehicle in terms of the value of the vehicle. If the repair costs are more than the car is worth, Succeed will just pay the value of the car. There is a total loss calculator function in ClaimCenter. The adjuster can use it to figure out how to proceed with this claim. Since the total loss calculator is related to an exposure, Chris starts by opening the exposures screen. He sees an exposure for Mark's vehicle, so he opens it to look at the details. He opens the total loss calculator. He clicks edit to make changes to the exposure. Chris knows that the vehicle is over 10 years old. And has over 100,000 miles. Mark, also told him that an extrication was required to remove him from the vehicle. He clicks, update, to save his changes and to see if the vehicle is a total loss. He sees that the calculator has qualified the vehicle as a total loss. Because the vehicle is considered a total loss, a new tab for vehicle salvage appears on the exposure. Chris goes to the claim work plan to see if anything has changed. He sees that there are two new activities, recover vehicle, and salvage vehicle. Moving forward on claim adjudication, Chris needs to make a payment against this exposure. He adds a check using the actions menu. He expected to simply issue a check to Mr. Henderson, but there are validation errors that must be fixed before he can continue. Claim Center uses validation levels to identify the maturity of a claim and its exposures. The claim and exposure are currently at the lowest validation level, new loss completion. This is fine for the early stages of adjudication, but in order to make payments, Claim Center requires that the claim and exposure be at the ability to pay validation level. Claim Center uses rules to identify validation, issues and set the validation level. The first, error states that in California, the insured driver's license number is required to make a payment. To correct the data, Chris clicks on the error to open the parties involved screen. He then selects Mark Henderson. He opens the contact details. The driver's license details are at the bottom of the screen, so he scrolls down on the page. The field in error is highlighted in red. Chris enters the driver's license number. He then selects California as the state. He scrolls up the page. And clicks Update. Chris then clears the error message. He has corrected the errors, but just to make sure, he uses the validation option to check that the claim and exposure, are at ability to pay. He sees that there are no errors, so he can proceed with issuing a check. He clears the validation results to close the worksheet. Just as before, he uses the actions menu to create a check. Since this payment is for Mark's vehicle, the payee is Mark Henderson. Chris continues to the next step of the check wizard. The payment is for Mark's vehicle, so Chris chooses first party vehicle, claim cost, auto body, as the reserve line for this payment. This is a partial payment. Chris enters $4,700 for the payment amount and applies the deductible. He continues to the last step. After reviewing the payment details, Chris creates the check. He notices that the check status is pending approval. Chris goes to the work plan. An activity has been added for his supervisor to approve the payment. Chris is done with this claim for now, so he logs out of claim center. This is the end of the exposures and financials demonstration.
