  "full_text": "In this demonstration, Betty Baker takes a call from Andrew Williams who is reporting an accident. During the call, Betty looks at the coverage details of Andrew Williams's policy. When she creates the claim, she also manually creates some exposures. The exposures help, illustrate the relationship of the line of business model to the user interface and business. Betty logs into ClaimCenter. Andrew Williams is calling in to report an accident and to open a claim. Betty selects Claim, New Claim. She enters the first part of Andrew's last name. And clicks Search. Betty wants to verify a few of the policy details with Andrew before she creates the claim. She clicks the policy number to see the details. She sees that the policy is personal, auto, and that it is in force. She also sees that there are two vehicles covered on the policy. Once she verifies those details with Andrew, she closes the policy details screen. Andrew told her that the accident was today, so she selects today as the law state. With the policy and law state selected, she clicks next to start the claim entry. Betty wants to look at some of the policy details now that she has started entering the claim. She clicks Policy. She clicks Policy Details to see the specific details and coverages. On the Policy Details screen, Betty sees a few more details about the vehicles covered on this policy. She can also drill down to see more details about either of these vehicles. She clicks the link on the first vehicle. This is the vehicle. This is the vehicle, information for the Ford XLT. It shows vehicle data, like make and model, year, VIN number, and license plate and state. At the bottom of the page, it shows the coverages for the vehicle. Notice the deductible, exposure limit and incident limits for each of the coverages. These values come from integration with a policy system. Now that Betty has looked at the vehicle details. Now that Betty has looked at the vehicle details, she returns to the policy. She is done with the policy, so Betty clicks, back, to return to the new claim wizard. Betty selects Andrew as the reporter for the claim. Andrew reported that the accident was in the 2013 XLT, so she selects it as the involved vehicle. When she selects the Ford XLT, details about its specific coverages display, including deductibles and limits for each coverage. For comparison, Betty selects the other vehicle. Notice that the liability bodily injury coverage for the Ford FX4, is $75,000 per incident, with a $300,000 limit. The same coverage for the Ford XLT, is $10,000 per incident, with a $30,000 limit. Also, the Ford FX4, has rental reimbursement coverage, whereas the Ford XLT, does not. The claim is for the Ford XLT, so Betty D selects the Ford FX4. Now that the basic information is complete, she clicks next. Loss cause is restricted by the loss type, such as, auto, or property. This is to make sure that the loss cause makes sense based on the type of loss. In this case, the policy type, personal, auto, is associated with the line of business, personal auto line, which in turn is associated with the auto loss type. Therefore, since the loss type is, auto, the causes are restricted to auto type causes such as collision while turning left, glass breakage, rollover, and so on. It would not make sense for an auto, claim to have a loss cause of burglary or mold. Andrew told her that he hit another vehicle, so she selects collision with motor vehicle as the loss cause. Because he told her that he hit the other vehicle, she also sets the fault rating to ensure it at fault. Betty enters the location of the loss. This is a new location. She clicks next to continue to the next step of the wizard. Betty selects towing, and asks Andrew if he needs that, service. She reminds Andrew, that he does have towing coverage and the limit is $400. Andrew says that he does not need towing, at least for now. The services shown here are not, coverages. These are services that may be arranged for the client during claim intake. However, these services will show no coverage behind the service if there is no coverage for the service on the policy. Notice the difference between the rental, and towing services. The rental service is available, but it does show that this is not covered on the policy. Since he doesn't need any other services, Betty clicks next. The last page of the new claim wizard shows that there is one exposure. This exposure was created by business rules during the new claim wizard. There was a passenger in Andrew's truck who was injured in the accident. This will be an additional exposure. Because the exposure is for bodily injury, Betty clicks New Exposure and selects the Ford XLT, a covered vehicle on the policy. Then she selects the coverage liability, bodily injury and property damage, and finally, the sub-coverage liability, bodily injury. This exposure is for a passenger who was injured in the accident, so Betty adds a new injury incident. The injured person is a new person. The injured person is Kayla Williams, so Betty enters the first and last name. Betty clicks Update, to create the person. She sets the loss party to third party liability. Next, Betty clicks OK to create the injury incident. Next, Betty selects Kayla, as the claimant. Then she sets the claimant type to, occupant of insured's vehicle. Finally, Betty clicks OK to create the exposure. In addition to creating an exposure for a specific coverage on the policy, Betty can also create an exposure by coverage type. These coverages may or may not be on the policy. In this case, Betty selects Uninsured Motorist, Bodily Injury, as the coverage. The new exposure screen is the same regardless of whether or not the coverage is on the policy. This simply allows the user to create exposures regardless of policy coverage. In this case, Betty does not need to create the extra exposure, so she clicks Cancel. The claim now has two exposures, one for the vehicle, and another for bodily injury. Betty clicks Finish to create the claim. Notice that the claim is automatically assigned to the Houston Claims Center and Joe Ramirez. That is because the accident occurred in the 77089 zip code. Betty is done for now, so she logs out of Claims Center. This ends the auto claim and the line of business demonstration.",
