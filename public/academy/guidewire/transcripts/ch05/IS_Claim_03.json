  "full_text": "Succeed Insurance has decided to open a claims office in Houston, Texas. They have hired an adjuster, and initially the office will handle a small region. This region will consist of a few zip codes in the area. After a while, they plan on expanding the region to include all of South Texas. To set up the new office, a Succeed Administrator logs into ClaimCenter. The administrator has access to a number of administrative functions, including the new office. including everything required to set up a new office. Those functions include creating and managing regions, groups, users, and security. The administrator starts by clicking the Administration tab. Functions for handling users, groups, and regions, are all within the Users and Security screens. The administrator expands the Users and Security menu in the sidebar. First, he looks at the defined security zones. Security zones. Security zones. Security zones are one of the constructs that prevent users from seeing claims for which they are not authorized. For example, someone who is in the workers' comp security zone cannot see auto and property claims. Succeed has three security zones defined. Next, the administrator looks at the authority limit profiles. An authority limit profile sets limits on the transaction amounts a user can create without requiring further approval. The administrator opens the adjustment an adjuster profile to view its limits. An adjuster profile to view its limits. An adjuster who is assigned this profile can create claim payments without the need for further approval, as long as the total payments to date for the claim are less than $15,000. They may also create payments for up to $1,000 more than the reserves without further approval. Next, the administrator looks at attributes. Attributes can be assigned to users to help identify skills or training that may be useful in a due and adjudicating claims. This is generally customer-specific, so claim-centered does not include any attributes in the base application. It is up to each customer to decide what special attributes they need, and to create them. In setting up the Houston office, the administrator wants to identify those users who speak Spanish. He starts by adding an attribute. He enters Spanish Speaking for the Attribute Name. He also enters a description that may be helpful in deciding if this attribute applies to a specific user. Finally, he selects language as the attribute type. The administrator saves the new attribute. Now that the attribute is created, he continues to regions. This is a partial list of the regions that are defined in the base application. The administrator adds a new region. The new region is for South Texas. This region initially consists of several zip codes. The administrator adds the first zip code. The value is 77089. Using the Add button, the administrator adds additional zip codes until there are 4 in the South Texas region. The administrator saves his changes to create the new region. Now that the South Texas region is created, the administrator can create a group. He uses the Actions menu to create a new group. He enters a name for the new group. The new group will handle auto claims, so he sets the type to auto. He uses Select Group to assign the parent group. The Houston office reports in through the Local Claim Offices group. The administrator searches for a user to assign as the supervisor for this group. He knows the user's name starts with TW, so he enters this into the username field. He searches for the user. The search results include two users with a user name that starts with TW. The administrator selects Todd Wilson. Next, he sets the security zone to auto and property. Finally, he saves the changes and creates the new group. Now that the group is created, the administrator can select the region or regions the group serves. He clicks Edit to start the process. And clicks the Regions tab. On the Regions tab, he clicks Add, to add a region to the group. He knows that the Houston Claims Center will serve the South Texas region, so he enters South as the search criterion. Then, he clicks Search. The results show two regions that begin with South. He selects South Texas region. Because he could have checked multiple regions, he must click Select after the region or regions are selected to add them to the group. Now he saves all of the changes for the group. The Regions screen shows the South Texas region and the zip codes that are covered. Now that the group is created, the administrator uses the Actions menu to create a new user. To create the user, he enters the user's name, Joe Ramirez, and provides a user name and password. Next, he assigns Joe a role. Joe is going to be an adjuster in the Houston Claims Center. Next, the administrator assigns Joe, to, a group. He expands the local claim offices node in the groups tree to locate the Houston office. He finds and selects the Houston Claims Center. The next step is to assign an authority limit. For Joe to work as an adjuster, he needs authority limits. There are two ways to set authority limits. One is to create a custom profile using the Add Authority Limits button to manually add limits that apply only to Joe, and the other is to use an existing profile. In this case, the administrator selects the existing adjuster profile. With the authority limits set, the administrator moves on to attributes. Joe speaks Spanish fluently, so the administrator clicks, Add, to start the process of assigning the Spanish speaking attribute to Joe. He enters a few characters as a search criterion in the name field and clicks Search. He selects Spanish, Speaking, and clicks Select to assign the attribute to Joe. After assigning the attribute, he looks at regions. This screen is used to assign regions to Joe beyond those assigned to his group. Succeed Insurance only wants groups to have regions, so no changes are made to this tab. The administrator clicks Update to save the new user. Now that the user is created within the group and region, claims created within that, region will be assigned to Joe. To demonstrate this, the administrator logs out of Claim Center. Customer Service Representative Ida Belt logs into Claim Center. She creates a new claim as quickly as possible to show that based on the location, it will be assigned to Joe and the Houston office. The claim will be for Ray Newton, so Ida enters, N-E-W-T, as the last name and searches for his policy. The Ray Newton policy is found and selected, and she selects today as the lost date. She continues to the basic information step. Ray Newton called to report the claim, so Ida selects Ray from the name drop-down list. Ray reported that the 1996 Toyota was involved in an accident. Ida continues to the next step of the wizard. The loss causes collision with a motor vehicle. Ida enters the location details of the accident. Notice that the zip code is 77089, which is one of the zip codes assigned to the Houston Claim Center. She clicks Next to go to the next step of the wizard. Because this is a simple claim, no services will be added. The last step is to create and assign the claim. The assignment uses the automated assignment rules. Ida clicks Finish to create and assign the claim. The Houston Claim Center is assigned the South Texas region, which includes the zip code 77089. Because the accident occurred in zip code 77089, the claim was assigned to that group and to the only user in that group, Joe Ramirez. This sends the regions, groups, and users demonstration.",
