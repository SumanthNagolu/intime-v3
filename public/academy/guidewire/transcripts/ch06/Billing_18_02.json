  "full_text": "This demonstration shows how to create a list bill account. Then it shows how to designate the list bill account as the alternate payer of a policy. In a production environment, the creation of list bill accounts is tightly controlled. A typical scenario is that a marketing or underwriting or finance group has thoroughly vetted the new list bill payer, before sending a request to the authorized billing person, who sets up the account. To create an account for this list bill demo, I first click the account tab. I click the actions menu button. Notice the actions menu shows just one option, new account. I select new account. I'll start by selecting the type of account. I select list bill, from the list of account types. Then I'll scroll up to show you the extra fields that are available only for the account. List bill accounts. Most accounts do not have payment plans or invoice streams associated with them. However, when I selected List bill as the account type, the user interface automatically displayed these fields for adding payment plans and invoice streams. Let's go back to the top, to fill in the required fields for the new account. For the account name, I'll enter Permapal. I type in Permapal Billing plan is the next required field. I click in the field And I select BP01 from the list of billing plans. Next is the delinquency plan field I select DP01 from the list of delinquency plans. Next, let's look at the invoicing dates fields For twice per month policies, there are two days of the month, 1st and 15th. This payment interval is typically used for synchronizing invoices with a company's payroll. Another required field is send invoices by I'll select email An account must have a contact. Let's scroll up so we can create the contact. I click Add to add the contact. And I select Add New Company I type in the company name, which is the same as the account name The address is 1 Elm Street I fill in the rest of the address. The city is Kingston And the state is Alaska Every account must have a primary payer. So I click Yes for primary payer Now I click OK Every list bill payer must have at least one payment plan. However, after the list bill account is created, I will be allowed to add more payment plans to it. I scroll up to the payment plan fields. And I click Add And I click Add Permapal needs only one payment plan with a twice per month payment interval. This is because Permapal matches the employer's payroll, which is paid on the 1st and 15th of every month. I'll add PP05, which is a twice per month plan. Finally, the list bill account needs at least one invoice stream. I click Add I click Add The default invoice stream periodicity is monthly. However, Permapal needs a twice per month invoice stream to match the payment plan. I select twice per month. I click OK to save the new invoice stream. And then I click Create account to save the new list bill account. On the account summary, notice there are no financials fields. As the message says, financials are available at the owner account level. Let's go to the account details screen. The supported payment plans link takes me to the payment plan associated with this list bill account. I click the link. PP05, which has a payment interval of twice per month, is the only associated payment plan. Let's go back to account details. I click the Actions menu button to view the actions that are available to a list bill account. I notice that the Actions menu does not have a menu item for adding a policy. This is because a list bill account is never a policyholder. It is only the payer of other policyholders' policies. Of course, in a production environment, no policies are created directly in Billing Center for any account. The purpose of a list bill payer is to pay policies. The purpose of a list bill payer is to pay policies. Adding Permapal as the designated payer of a list bill policy is our next topic. I click the arrow icon on the Account tab. And I select the Jeff Holmquist account. This account has a personal auto policy. Instead of paying for the policy directly, Jeff has arranged for his employer, Permapal, to deduct the payments from his paycheck. Initially, the policy was not created as a list bill policy. As we see, the billing method is Direct Bill, not List Bill. Let's see how to change the policy to List Bill with Permapal as the list bill payer. I click the details link in the sidebar. I scroll up to the billing method field. I notice the billing method field has a button that allows me to change the billing method, without going into Edit Mode. I simply click the arrow button on the billing method field. I select Change to List Bill. Here, I need to fill in the list bill payer, the payment plan, and the invoice stream fields. I can search for the payer. I'll search for accounts with names that begin with a P. Now I click Search. Permapal is the first account in the list. I select it. Permapal has only one associated payment plan and invoice stream, so filling in these fields is easy. I click Next. I click Next. On the policy details screen, we can see immediately that the billing method field is now List Bill. Let's go back to the Jeff Holmquist account. How many invoices do you think Jeff will have? Let's see. I click the Invoices link in the sidebar. The answer is, None. All the invoices are now on Permapal's invoice stream. However, Jeff does have charges. Let's take a look. We can see the invoice items for the premium charge. Permapal's account number is listed as the payer for each invoice item. I select the Taxes charge. The invoice item for the taxes charge is listed with Permapal as the payer. Now let's see Permapal's invoices and charges. I click one of the payer links. We'll look at the invoices first. The invoices screen shows all the invoices for Jeff's policy. Now we'll look at the charges. The charges screen shows both charges for Jeff's policy with the invoice items listed. Let's filter on Only, Owned. As we expected, the charges disappear. Permapal does not own any charges. This time, I select the Only Payer filter. Filtering on Only Payer causes both charges to be displayed with their invoice items. In a production system, a list bill payer is responsible for paying invoices for many policies owned by several different accounts. Instead of adding more policies to the list bill payer in this demo, I'll leave it to you to do during the lab. This concludes our demonstration of creating and testing a list bill payer.
