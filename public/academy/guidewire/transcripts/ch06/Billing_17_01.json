  "full_text": "In this demonstration, we'll add a third policy to the Adele Chi Sage's account. You are already familiar with this account from the examples in the lesson on account level billing. The purpose of the demonstration is to illustrate how the billing settings on an account and the periodicity of a policy together determine the invoice stream that is used in account level billing. Let's take a look at the billing information on the account details screen. This account uses account level billing, which means that policies paid by this account can share invoices. Under invoices. Under invoices. There are various settings for fixing invoice anchor dates. Because the policies paid by this account are invoiced monthly, the setting we're interested in is monthly policies, day of month, which is the fifth. BillingCenter uses this setting to assign the anchor date to the invoice stream. Now let's visit the invoice stream. As we know, the periodicity of the stream is monthly. Notice the anchor date for this monthly invoice stream. The invoice stream label default day of month is 5, as we expected. And, because this is not policy level billing, there is no overriding invoice day. Now let's look at the invoices to see how the invoice stream anchor date impacted the invoice dates. On the invoices screen, we see all the invoices have the same bill date, the fifth of the month. This is because the invoice stream has an anchor date of the fifth. Let's add a third policy. I clicked the actions menu button. And I select add policy to open the policy issuance wizard. First, I type in the policy number. This is a commercial auto policy. So I select business auto from the list of products. I click in the payment plan field. And I select PPO5, which is a twice per month plan. I click next, to go to step 2. I'll add the premium charge first. I click add. The charge amount is $12,000. I type in the amount. Next, I click add, to add a taxes charge. I click in the type field. And I select taxes as the charge type. The tax amount is $1030. I type in the amount. Now I click finish. Billing center calculates the total. I click finish again to complete the billing instruction. Let's first look at the invoice streams. The question we want answered is, will the new policy use the same invoice stream as the other two policies? The answer is, no, because a payment interval of twice per month requires a different periodicity from a monthly interval. So a second invoice stream, twice per month, has been added to the account. Let's look at it. Notice there are two anchor dates. These dates were set using the invoicing dates settings on the account details screen. Let's take another look at the account details. Notice the two values for twice per month policies. The two dates for twice per month policies are in contrast to the single anchor date for every other week policies. Every other week policies need only a single anchor date to use as a starting point for calculating invoice dates. Now let's revisit the invoices screen. On the invoices screen, we see lots more invoices. Let's filter on invoice stream to view only the twice per month invoices. I click the invoice stream field. And I select twice per month. The bill dates reflect the two anchor days from the invoice stream, the first and the 15th. We've seen that multiple policies can share the same invoices. However, the policies must have compatible payment intervals. A policy that is billed twice per month cannot be billed on monthly invoices. This concludes our demonstration on account level billing and invoice streams. This concludes our demonstration on the !",
