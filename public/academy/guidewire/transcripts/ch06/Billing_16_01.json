  "full_text": "This demonstration shows how to process a manual disbursement in BillingCenter. Here's the Snyder & Associates account, which has a commercial package policy. The customer has sent a payment for $11,000. The money was already allocated to fully pay the policy. But the amount of the payment was greater than the amount billed, leaving $1,902 remaining in the unapplied fund for the policy. BillingCenter will automatically disburse the money in the next few days. However, the policyholder has requested that the payment will be paid for the policy. BillingCenter has requested a refund for the remaining money as soon as possible. I'm going to create a manual disbursement right now so there's no delay. I click the Actions menu button. And I select Disbursement from the New Transaction submenu. This opens the account disbursement wizard. First, I need to select the unapplied fund that holds the money I plan to disburse. I select the designated unapplied fund for the policy. Next, I enter the amount of the disbursement. I type $1902 in the amount field. I'll make the payment date the same as the current billing system date. Now I need to select a reason for the disbursement. I select Overpayment. The Pay Info fields on the screen are correct as is. There are no changes needed. I click Next. Step 2 is the disbursement confirmation step. I visually verify the disbursement amount and due date before clicking Finish. Now, let's look at the disbursement we just created in the Disbursements screen. I click the Disbursements link in the sidebar. The new disbursement is already selected. I immediately notice the disbursement has a status of Approved. It was automatically approved by the system. At this point, the disbursement is ready to be sent, but it has not been sent yet. It is waiting for the disbursement batch process to run. While we are on the disbursements screen, let's see what actions are available for the disbursement. I'll click Edit to go into Edit Mode. The Reject button is available. We know the disbursement was automatically approved by the system. However, if a mistake had been made, I can reject the disbursement and create a new one later if required. Notice there's a second Reject button. This button does more than simply change the status of the disbursement to Rejected. It also causes Billing Center to create a trouble ticket with a hold on automatic disbursements. I would click this button if there were a problem with the account such that no disbursements should be issued until the problem is resolved. The hold will not be released until the trouble ticket is closed. But no changes are needed at this time, so I click Cancel. Normally, an approved disbursement is not sent until the disbursement batch process runs at its scheduled time. For the purpose of this demo, I'll switch to SuperUser to manually run the disbursement batch process so that we can see the results. I'll look for the disbursement batch process and click Run. On the disbursements screen, we can see the results. The batch process has set the Date Issued field to Today's date and changed the status to Sent. Also, the payment status is now Draft, indicating a request for payment has been sent to a third-party payment system. Let's return to Edit Mode to learn what actions we can perform on a sent disbursement. Both Reject buttons are disabled. A sent disbursement cannot be rejected. However, the Void button is now available. This button allows me to void a disbursement after it has been sent. If the customer does not receive the money for some reason such as a bank error or the wrong payee address, I can void the disbursement and create a new one. Voiding is not necessary here, so I simply click Cancel. Now, I'll go back to the account summary. Here I see Total Unapplied is now empty. The overpayment has been fully disbursed to the customer. This concludes our demonstration on manual disbursements. This concludes our demonstration on manual disbursements.
