  "full_text": "For this demonstration, I'm going to show you how to test delinquency processing. In a production system, delinquency processing occurs over a period of weeks. However, by manually advancing the testing clock and running batch processes, we can see the whole delinquency process in a few minutes. I have set up a test policy for the Ella Lundstrom account. We're looking at the invoices screen for the account. The first invoice is due and has been paid in full. The second invoice is billed but not paid. Notice the date in the info bar is the due date of the second invoice. This invoice has not been paid yet. Let's go to the account summary. Here we see an alert bar to indicate this account will become delinquent if the expected payment is not received today. Now I'll open the policy. Here we see a similar alert about the upcoming delinquency on the policy summary. Let's switch to superuser to make the policy delinquent. First, I'll advance the clock by one day. Then I go to the server tools tab. I scroll the display to find the invoice due batch process. Here is invoice due. I click run. Let's return to Jeff Park to see the result. To refresh the browser, I click the details link in the sidebar. Then I click the summary link to return to the policy summary screen. Let's take a look at what has changed on the policy summary screen. The screen has been designed to quickly provide the most commonly needed information about an active delinquency. The alert bar message has changed to an alert stating the policy has a past due delinquency. The delinquencies field has been updated to show this policy has had one delinquency in 12 months. In the financials section, the past due field displays the past due amount and also indicates a $50 late fee has been charged. The policy summary screen gives us the high level status of this account. Now, let's view the details of the delinquency process. I'll do this by clicking on the link in the alert bar to open the delinquencies screen. This screen shows the delinquency is open and the delinquency reason is past due. I'll scroll to show the events area of the screen. Here we see a list of the workflow events that you can use to track delinquency processing. Two events have completed, Dunning Letter 1 and Late Fee. The next event is Dunning Letter 2, which will cause a second Dunning Letter to be sent to the delinquent policyholder. Inception date refers to the start date of the delinquency. In the example, the inception date is one day after the due date of the unpaid invoice, which is today. The Dunning Letter 2 event is scheduled for inception date plus seven days. So I'll switch to Super User and add seven days to the billing center date. First I'll go to internal tools to advance the testing system clock. I select testing system clock from the menu. Now I click add week to advance the clock to the date of the Dunning Letter 2 event. Next, I need to run a batch process to wake up the workflow. I click the server tools tab. I scroll the list to locate the workflow writer batch process. Now I click run. Let's return to the Jeff Park browser to see the result. To refresh the display, I click the journal link in the sidebar. Now I return to the delinquencies screen. Immediately, I see the current event is Dunning Letter 2 and the next event is send notice of intent to cancel. Let's look at the second activity. The workflow has updated the Dunning Letter 2 event to show the event is complete and the date it was completed. The workflow has also created two activities. The general activity is an activity that specifies the Dunning Letter was sent. I'll click the details link so that we get more information about this activity. We can see the subject, description and priority. This activity is really just an informational activity and does not require any user action. Let's look at the second activity. The second activity is different from the general activity. It is an approval activity that requires approval to be approved. The second activity is a result of the cancellation. Notice the mandatory column is set to yes. This activity is mandatory because the delinquency workflow is waiting for this activity to be completed. I'll click the details link so that we get more information about this activity. Notice this activity has an approve button. It also has a due date and an escalation date. If this activity is not completed by the escalation date, it will be escalated based on business rules. Although the activity is not assigned to me, I can approve it, so I click approve. Now, I click complete activity. We can see the activity status has changed to complete and the approved field changed to yes. The next event in the events list is send notice of intent to cancel, which is scheduled 14 days from the inception date. The current date is 7 days after inception, so I need to advance the clock by a week. For this, I switch to super user. First, I click the internal tools tab. And I select testing system clock from the menu. I click add week to add another 7 days to the billing center clock to reach the target date of the event. Now let's run the workflow writer batch process. Here is the workflow writer batch process. I click run. Let's return to the Jeff Park browser to view the result. To refresh the display, I click the journal link in the sidebar. Now I return to the delinquencies screen. I scroll the display to view the activities and events. The intent to cancel notification event has been marked complete. Also, the workflow created a new general activity about the notification. Let's return to the policy summary. The most recent workflow event changed the cancellation status to pending cancellation. At this point, the delinquency process is waiting for a response from the policy administration system that the policy has been cancelled. When billing center receives notification, the status will be changed to cancelled. Let's visit the delinquencies screen once more. There are other delinquency workflow events listed. The policy can be sent to a collection agency. Ultimately, the workflow can write off the overdue amount. There is also a rescind slash reinstate event. All of these events require some configuration. This concludes our demonstration on testing delinquency processing.
