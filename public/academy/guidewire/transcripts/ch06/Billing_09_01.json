  "full_text": "For this demonstration, I am going to enter three payments into BillingCenter. I'll use the Multiple Payment Entry Wizard to get this task done as quickly as possible. Currently, I'm looking at my desktop. I click the Actions menu button and select Multiple Payment Entry from the New Payment menu. I'm on the first step of the Multiple Payment Entry Wizard, where I can enter a set of payments, each with a target of an account, invoice, policy, or producer. The first payment is for an account, a MaryQuest, and the first payment is for a number of $3.5. In the Account Number field, I'll click the Account Picker button. I already know the name of the account. I type the first four letters of a MaryQuest in the Account Name field. Then I click Search. Here's the a MaryQuest account. I click Select. I type in the amount. The second payment is from OpenZoom. The payment has a note saying the payment is for their business owner's policy B0010Zoom. The amount of this check payment is $540. So now I'll enter the payment. Policy numbers are unique in BillingCenter, so there's only one policy with that policy number. I'll search on policy numbers beginning with B0010Zoom. I click Search. Here's the policy I am looking for. I click Select. I type in $540. The third payment is from Standox LLC. The payment also has a note on it saying the payment is for their commercial property policy number CP01 Standox. This time, I type in the policy number without searching for it. This payment is for $1,800. I type in the amount. We have entered all three payments. I'll click Next to go to Step 2. BillingCenter has detected a problem. The error message informs me that policy number CP01 Standox cannot be found in BillingCenter. So either the policy number is incorrect or the policy has not yet been set up in BillingCenter. I'll research that later. The second part of the message suggests using the policy picker or selecting Suspense Payment. I want to record the payment now, so I'll simply change the type from Payment to Suspense. I select Suspense from the list. I click Next to move to Step 2. Everything looks good, so I'll click Finish to complete the wizard. Let's take a look at the Suspense Payment. Notice I can edit the payment. I can also manually apply it as soon as the CP01 Standox policy is known by BillingCenter. We'll talk more about Suspense Payments in a later lesson. This concludes our demonstration on entering multiple payments.
