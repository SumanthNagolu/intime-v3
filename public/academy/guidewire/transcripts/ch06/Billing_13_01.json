  "full_text": "In this demonstration, we create a trouble ticket. The trouble ticket will place holds on delinquency processing and invoice billing. Ashley, a policyholder, has requested a reduction in her bill because she has just lowered the coverage on her homeowner's policy. An alert warns that the account has a passed due delinquency. Let's look at the policy. $130 is passed due and a late fee of $50 has been charged. The first step in resolving this issue is to place a hold on delinquency processing and on billing. I can do this by means of a trouble ticket. I click the trouble tickets link in the sidebar. I click New to launch the trouble ticket wizard. I need to select the type of trouble ticket. I select Customer Complaint from the list of types. Next is the trouble ticket. Next is the trouble ticket subject. I enter the policy number that the trouble ticket is for. I type in a short description in the details field. The bill needs to be adjusted because of a change in coverage. Next is the priority of this trouble ticket. I select Urgent from the list. Next is the priority of this customer. We want to act fast to fix this issue to keep the customer happy. So I type in today's date in the date due field. I also type in today's date for the escalation date. Let's go to step 2. Here I see the account, policy, and policy period are already associated with the trouble ticket. This means a trouble ticket alert will be displayed in the UI for the account, the policy, and the policy period. Let's go to the next step. The primary purpose of this trouble ticket is to place holds on both delinquencies and billing, so I will select those two holds. A hold on delinquency blocks the automatic processing of delinquencies. I also place a hold on invoice sending. I decide not to specify dates for automatically releasing the holds on a certain date. The holds can be released manually. Also, closing the trouble ticket automatically releases all trouble ticket holds. Let's move to step 4. In step 4, I can add any related transactions. This is purely for documentation purposes. Here I'll add the late fee that Ashley was charged. I select the policy late fee charge transaction. And click select. Let's go to step 5. This is the last step. I want to assign the trouble ticket to myself. I select Jeff Park. Now I click finish to save the trouble ticket. The new trouble ticket is listed here. I click the trouble ticket number to view the trouble ticket. There are some tabs at the bottom of the trouble ticket screen. Currently, the trouble ticket has no notes or activities. I will add an activity to the ticket later in the demo. Let's look at transactions. On the transactions tab, I see the late fee transaction listed. Let's look at the holds tab. The holds I placed on billing and delinquency processing are shown here. Let's go back to the policy. As expected, on the policy summary, troubled ticket alerts for the policy and policy period have been generated. Let's see what's happening with the delinquency. The status of the past due delinquency is on hold. The next delinquency event, which is Dunning Letter 2, is in one week. I'll switch to Super User to advance the clock and run a batch process to wake up the workflow. I click Add Week to advance the clock by 7 days. Next I click Server Tools to run the batch process. I click the sort arrow icon to make it easy to access the Workflow Writer batch process. I find Workflow Writer and I click Run. Let's return to Jeff Park's browser to see what has changed. First, I'll refresh the display by visiting another screen. Now I return to the delinquencies screen. The target date for the Dunning Letter 2 event is now red. But the event cannot be completed because of the trouble ticket hold. We know the delinquency hold is working. Now I want to see the effect of the hold on invoice sending. I'll switch over to Super User to make the third invoice build. First I add a month to the testing clock. Next, I go to the Server Tools tab. Here's the invoice batch process. I click Run. Let's return to the Jeff Park browser to see the result. I click the account number in the info bar to go to the account. Let's go to the Invoices screen for the account to see how Billing Center handles the hold on billing. Here's the invoice we're interested in. Notice the due date has passed. The status field for the third invoice is carried forward. This means Billing Center carried the invoice items forward to the next planned invoice as a result of the invoice hold. The amount field on the third invoice is empty. This concludes our demonstration on trouble tickets and trouble ticket holds. Let's return to the lesson to learn more about trouble tickets.
