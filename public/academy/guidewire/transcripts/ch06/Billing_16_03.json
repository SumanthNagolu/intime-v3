  "full_text": "In this demonstration, we'll see how BillingCenter processes automatic disbursements that require approval. Here's the Snyder and Associates account from the previous demonstration. First, let's look at the billing plan fields that control automatic disbursement behavior. I'll go to the account details to find the billing plan for the account. Here is the link to the billing plan, BP01. I'll click the link. In the automatic disbursements area of the billing plan, we see disbursements over $500 require approval. Also, approval required is set to yes. These two options direct BillingCenter to create an approval activity for disbursement amounts over $500. Notice the days until payment created setting. This is the reason the disbursement in the previous demo was issued two days after the date the disbursement was created. Let's return to the account. The policy number is listed at the account. The policy number is listed at the bottom of the account details screen. I'll go to the policy summary so that I can simulate the policy change billing instruction. I click the Actions menu button. And select Change Policy from the menu. Let's go right to step 2. I click Add, to add a premium charge. Next, I click in the amount field. The amount of the premium reduction is $700, so I type in negative 700. I click Finish. The total field displays the amount in red. Looks good. So I click Finish a second time. Next, I click the policy summary. The policy summary shows $700 in designated unapplied. Now, I'll return to the account. I click the Disbursements link in the sidebar. The disbursements from the previous two demos are listed here. Let's switch to Super User to create the automatic disbursement. First, I'll advance the testing system clock by 2 days. The due date for the disbursements. The due date for the disbursement is September 8. I click Change Date. Now, I go to Server Tools to run the automatic disbursement batch process. I see Automatic disbursement in the list of batch processes. I click Run. Let's return to the Jeff Park browser to see the result. Here's the new disbursement. The disbursement has a status of awaiting approval. As we saw earlier, the billing plan has the approval required threshold setting of $500, so any disbursement greater than that amount will require an approval. There are three ways to approve disbursements. The first is to click Edit and then click Approve. I'll click Edit. The Approve button is enabled. Of course, the approval will be successful only if Jeff Park is authorized to approve a disbursement of $700. Instead of manually approving the disbursement, I'll click Cancel so I can show you the two other ways to approve the disbursement. I click the arrow icon on the Desktop tab. And I select Disbursements. The Disbursements screen by default shows all open disbursements from the past seven days. I'll click the Disbursement Reason link. On this screen, I don't need to go into Edit mode to approve or reject the disbursement. The buttons are already enabled. However, instead of approving the disbursement here, let's look at the third method. I click Cancel. To show the third approval method, I need to search for the Approval Activity. I click the arrow icon on the Search tab. And I select Activities from the list. On the Search Activities screen, I can select Approval as the activity pattern. And so I select Approval. I know the activity is assigned to Jeff Park. I click Select User to find the Jeff Park user. I type Jeff in the First Name field. I click Search to find the Jeff Park user. And now I click Select. I click Search to find all Approval activities assigned to Jeff Park. Here is the Approval activity for the $700 disbursement to Snyder & Associates. I click the Subject link. After a quick review of the activity details, I click Approve. Let's revisit the disbursement. To do this, I first go to the Account. I select Snyder & Associates from the list. Now I click the Disbursements link in the sidebar. On the Disbursements list, I can see the status of the disbursement is approved. From this point on, the disbursement process is the same for all approved disbursements, so there is no need to demonstrate that part of the process again. This concludes our demonstration of automatic disbursements that require approval.
