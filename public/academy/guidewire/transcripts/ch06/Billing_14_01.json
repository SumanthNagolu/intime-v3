  "full_text": "In this demonstration, we will look at the basic components involved in the commission process in BillingCenter. Let's start by viewing a producer. I click the arrow on the Search tab. I select Producers from the menu. We'll search for Stevens Gray Insurance on the Producers Search screen. I'll type ST and click Search. Here is Stevens Gray Insurance LLC. I click the link. Clicking the producer name takes me to the summary screen for the producer. The first column shows basic information about this producer. Notice the tier is gold. A producer's tier indicates the level of service the producer generates and helps determine how much commission the producer earns. In the Status column, the fields track the commission earned and paid to the producer. The fields are empty right now, but we'll see these in action later in the demo. In the last column on the right, the field settings determine how and when BillingCenter pays commission to this producer. The direct bill fields in the top right specify that the commission day of the month is 20 and payment frequency is monthly. This means that Stevens Gray is paid commission on the 20th of each month. Stevens Gray has just sold a policy. Let's add the policy to BillingCenter so the producer will earn some commission. First, I'll open the Myra Hammond account. I click the arrow icon on the Account tab. I select the Myra Hammond account. Next, I click the Actions menu button to open the Policy issuance wizard. I select Add policy from the menu. As always, the first step is to enter the policy number. The product is Personal Auto. I select Personal Auto from the list. Next, the new policy needs a payment plan. And I select Personal Auto from the list. I select our Full Pay Payment Plan . Next, I want to add Stevens Gray as the primary producer. I'll click the Look Up button on the Primary field. This opens the Producer search screen. I enter ST for the producer name. Now I click Search. The search returns Stevens Gray Insurance. I click Select. Stevens Gray Insurance is now the primary producer on the policy. Because this producer has only one producer code, the code has been auto-filled for me. Notice there are also fields for secondary and referrer producers. A policy can have up to three producers earning commission. However, for this demo, we have a single producer, so I'll leave the other fields blank. I click Next to go to Steps. Step 2. On Step 2 of the wizard, I click Add to add a premium charge of $3,600. The type defaults to Premium. I type in the amount in the amount field. Now I click Finish. We now have a policy that earns commission. The new policy is listed on the account summary. Let's return to our producer. I select Stevens Gray Insurance LLC from the list. On the producer's summary screen, notice the $360 in both the Total Commission Reserve and Total Commission Expense fields. Why did Billing Center put this money into reserve? The answer is, when Billing Center received the issuance billing request for the policy, it set aside enough money in reserve to pay the total commission amount during the life of the policy. The commission rate for this producer is 10%, so 10% of $3,600 is $360. That is the amount Billing Center placed in reserve. Currently the Total Commission Payable field is empty. No commission has been earned yet. What causes the commission to be earned? The commission plan provides the answer. Let's go to the commission plan to see when Stevens Gray will earn commission on this policy. The commission plan link is next to the producer code. The policy we just created is associated with this commission plan through the producer code. There are three things I want to learn from the commission plan. What types of charges earn commission? What is the commission rate? And when will the commission be earned? Let's go to the commissionable items tab first. Here we see that premium charges will earn commission. Taxes do not earn commission. Let's return to the general tab. On the general tab, the commission earning rates are specified for the three producer roles. I can see that Stevens Gray, as the primary producer, earns 10% commission according to this plan. Under payable criteria, the earned commission field is set to on billing. This means the producer will earn commission over time as the policy is billed. There are a number of other fields for a commission plan, which we'll explore later. Let's bill an invoice so we can see the earned commission. I click the arrow on the account tab to return to the Myra Hammond account. I select Myra Hammond. I click the invoices link in the sidebar. There's only one invoice for this account. I notice that the bill date is today. I'll switch to the super user browser to bill the invoice. As super user, I'll simply run the invoice batch process to make the invoice billed. Let's return to the Jeff Park browser. I'll refresh the screen by clicking a link in the sidebar. I click the invoices link to return to the invoice. We see the status of the invoice is now billed. Let's take a look at the producer. I select Stevens Gray from the list. The policy in this scenario was billed in full on a single invoice, so all the commission was earned when the invoice was billed. If we had a policy that was invoiced over a number of installments, the commission would have been paid out proportionally as each installment was billed. Some money would be moved from reserve to payable with each invoice. As we saw earlier, the commission day of month for this producer is the 20th. I'll switch to super user to advance the clock and generate the producer's commission statement. I click the arrow icon on the internal tools tab. And I select testing system clock from the list. I click in the date field. I type in the new date of April 20th. Now I click change date. The testing system clock is now set to our producer's payment date. Next, I want to run a batch process to generate the producer payment. I find the producer payment batch process in the list of batch processes. I click run. Now let's return to the Jeff Park browser to see the result. We're back to the summary screen for the producer. I'll refresh the screen by clicking a link in the sidebar. Now I click the summary link to return to the producer summary. The $360 has moved from total commission payable to commission paid year to date. This means that we have paid the commission and currently there is no additional commission to be paid. The producer payment batch process updated the commission totals. It also generated a commission statement for the producer, which we'll look at next. I'll click the direct bill commission statements link to go to the list of commission statements for this producer. Here's the commission statement that was just generated. I'll click the statement number so we can view the statement details. The statement screen shows the policy activity for the producer. There is just one policy with an earned commission item in the amount of $360. I'll click the policy number to view the policy activity. Here we see the event that caused commission to be earned. In addition, the screen specifies the account, policy, and charge type, as well as the basis, commission rate and commission. This concludes our review of the commission process.",
