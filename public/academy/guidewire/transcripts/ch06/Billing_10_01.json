  "full_text": "The payment allocation plan is used by BillingCenter to automatically apply payments. In this demonstration, we take a look at the various settings on a payment allocation plan. Payment allocation plans are on the Administration tab along with the other BillingCenter plans. I click the arrow to expand Business Settings. And I click Payment Allocation Plans. The default payment allocation plan is shipped with BillingCenter. Let's take a look at it. The default payment allocation plan can be modified or used without changes. Another option is to clone it to use it as a starting point for a custom plan. This is what I will do. First I click Clone. The middle section of the plan is called what invoice items should be paid. When the payment allocation process runs, it looks at all unsettled invoice items associated with the account. The term settled means fully paid. Unsettled is not fully paid. This is where you can specify the invoice items to include in the payment allocation. Let's take a look at a few of the filters that are selected. I'll click the sort arrow icon in the name column to put these in alphabetical order. First, we have the Build or Do filter selected. This means that payment allocation will only consider invoice items that have a status of either Build or Do. Planned invoice items will not be included. As you saw in the previous demo, a payment can be earmarked for a specific invoice or policy period. The invoice and policy period filters ensure that a payment that is targeted for a specific invoice or policy period is applied only to that target. Finally, we have the positive filter. This filter restricts payment allocation to invoice items that have amounts greater than zero. There are additional filters in Billing Center that are not currently used in this plan. I'll click add to see what else is available. Next planned invoice, if selected, includes invoice items from the next planned invoice. Pass due restricts invoice items to those that are past due. Let's go back to our clone plan. Billing Center warns me that unsaved changes will be discarded. That's okay. Now that we've discussed filters, let's turn our attention to the bottom section of the screen. This is where the invoice item payment priority is specified. The priority determines the order in which invoice items will be paid. The priority list directs billing center to pay recapture charges first. Next billing center pays invoice items in order of their placement dates, oldest first, and finally, if there is money left over, the payment priority is by charge pattern priority. By the way, a recapture charge represents money the insurer wants to get back from a policyholder after an incorrect disbursement. As with filters, there are additional items you can use to prioritize the order in which a payment is applied to invoice items. I'll click add to take a look at these. There are a number of payment priority items available. Let's focus on Spread Access Even. This priority item tells the payment allocation plan to pay all billed and due invoice items first. And then if there is money left over, to pay the planned items proportionally. So let's select Spread Access Even. I click add priority. Our new priority item is now listed as the fourth priority item. I can control the order of the payment priorities, using the arrows in the move priority column. I'll click the move up arrow next to placement date to move it to the top. This means that items will first be paid in order of their placement dates. Now I'm going to move placement date back down by clicking on the move down arrow, because I want to pay recapture charges first. We've finished examining a payment allocation plan, so I'll just click cancel. This concludes our demonstration on payment allocation plans. We'll see you next time!",
