  "full_text": "In this demonstration, we are going to look at a scenario where a payment was received, but was applied to the wrong policy. Our customer, Todd Davidson, has a homeowner's policy and a personal auto policy with us. He paid for both policies using a single check. We have learned that the payment was not applied as he requested. Instead, the whole payment was applied to the homeowner's policy. The account summary shows the two policies, homeowner's and personal auto. Also, I see that the graph shows that $840 has been paid, but there is still an amount of $300 that has been billed but not paid. So let's fix this problem. We'll start by looking at the payment. I click payments in the sidebar. Here we can see the payment of $840. I'll click the payments so that we can view the payment details. The first two rows show the payment was applied to the billed invoice. The third row shows that $300 of the payment was applied to the next planned invoice. Instead, the $300 should have been applied to the billed invoice for the personal auto policy. Let's modify the payment. I'll select Modify Distribution from the list of payment actions. The Modify Payment screen is similar to the Direct Bill Payment screen. The Distribution tab shows that the payment has been applied to the billed and planned invoices for the homeowner's policy. I can reallocate the payment by adding invoice items from the personal auto policy to the allocation. First I click Override Distribution. Notice the Override toolbar is now displayed. I click Add Items to find all billed items, which I want to add to the payment distribution. The Add Items screen allows me to search for and then add unsettled invoice items from any policy to the payment allocation. Note the payer account is already set as a search criterion. I click Search. My first search returns several items. I decide to restrict the next search to invoice items that are on invoices with a billed status. I click the Build Status field. I select Billed from the list of statuses. Now I click Search. This time the search returned just two billed items. I click the checkbox next to each item. Now I click Add Selected Items. Notice the plus icon next to the items I added. The icon lets me know that these are the manually added items. The red amount in the remaining fields shows more money will be allocated than is available. To get a clearer view of the billed and planned invoices, I click the Aggregate field. I want to see a summary of the invoices. To remove the proposed allocation for the planned invoice, I click in the Override Amount field for the planned invoice. I enter 0 as the override amount. Now the available and distributed amounts are equal. To apply the modified payment allocation, I'll click Execute. On the Payments screen, we can see that the entire payment has been applied to billed invoice items only. Let's return to the Account Summary screen. In the Financials section of the screen, the pie chart details show that $840 has been paid and the billed amount is $0. I successfully modified the payment allocation as requested by the customer. This concludes our demonstration on reallocating a payment.
