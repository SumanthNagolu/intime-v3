  "full_text": "In this demonstration, we take a look at how BillingCenter handles suspense payments. I'll begin by entering a suspense payment for a policy BillingCenter does not know about. Subsequently, after the target policy is specified, the suspense payment will be applied to the unapplied fund associated with the policy. First I click the Actions menu button to open the Multiple Payment Entry wizard to create the payment. I select Multiple Payment Entry from the New Payment menu. I want to add a payment for policy number B001VADX with a payment amount of $3,600. I type in the policy number. The policy does not exist in BillingCenter, so I'll change the type to suspense. I select suspense. Next, I type in the amount. The amount of the payment is $3,600. Let's go to the next step. Step 2 is a confirmation step. Everything looks fine, so I'll click Finish. Let's take a look at the suspense payment. The suspense payments screen shows two payments. The one I just entered is highlighted. The other suspense payment is from a previous demo. Next, I'll create the target policies for these payments so you can see how BillingCenter applies suspense payments. I start by clicking the arrow icon for the account tab. First, I'll create the business owner's policy for VAADX, which is listed in the account dropdown. I want to create a new policy, so I click the Actions menu button. I select Add policy from the menu. In the policy issuance wizard, I start by typing in the policy number. I make sure the number matches the target policy number for one of the suspense payments. This is a business owner's policy. I select business owners from the list of products. I click in the Payment Plan field. We'll use PPO1 Payment Plan. Let's go to step 2. I click Add to add a premium charge. Premium is pre-selected. I simply need to enter the amount of the charge. The charge is for $3,600. I click Finish. Now that the first target policy has been created, I will create a target policy for the other suspense payment. This policy is for the Standox account, which I will search for. I click the arrow icon on the Search tab. I select Accounts. I want to search for the Standox account. I click in the Account Name field. I type ST. And click Search. I click the account number for Standox in the search results. Next I'll add a policy to the Standox account. I select Add policy from the menu. The policy number will be CPO1 Standox. This is a commercial property policy. I select Commercial property from the list of products. We'll use PPO1 Payment Plan. I select PPO1. I click Next to go to Step 2. I click Add. It's a premium charge for $1,800. I enter the amount. Next I click Finish. As we discussed earlier, there are two ways in Billing Center to release suspense payments, manual and automatic. First, we'll use the manual process. Let's return to the desktop. I click Suspense Payments in the sidebar. Here's the suspense payment for the VAIDACS policy. Now that the policy exists, I can apply the suspense payment. I click Apply. The Apply Suspense Payments screen allows me to change the payment target if needed. For example, I could select a different policy number. However, this is the correct policy number, so no changes are needed. I click Update to release the suspense payment. The suspense payment for VAIDACS is no longer listed on the Suspense Payments screen. I select All to show all the suspense payments. Now I can see the payment and its status of Applied. Let's return to the Account tab. So let's see where the payment money is in Billing Center. I'll open the Account Summary for VAIDACS. The Financials section shows the $3,600 in the total unapplied. I'll click the link. The Unapplied Funds detail screen shows us that the $3,600 payment is in the designated Unapplied Fund for the policy. That was a brief demonstration of manually allocating a suspense payment. Let's return to the desktop to learn about automatic allocation of a suspense payment. I click Suspense Payments to return to the Suspense Payments screen. Here's the suspense payment for $1,800 that I entered earlier. Currently the status is Open. Let's go to the SuperUser browser to run a batch process to release the payment from suspense. I look for the suspense payment batch process on the Batch Process Info screen in Server Tools. Here is the batch process. I click Run. And now we'll return to Jeff Park's browser. First, I'll refresh the display by visiting another screen. Now let's look at the suspense payment. Notice the status of the suspense payment has been changed to Applied. I'll revisit the Account Summary for Standox. I select the Standox account from the drop-down list. In the Account Summary for Standox, we can see there is $1,800 in the total unapplied field. I'll click this link. The Unapplied Funds detail screen shows that the $1,800 payment is in the unapplied fund for this policy. Both the manual and automatic approaches to releasing suspense payments achieve the intended results. This concludes our demonstration on handling suspense payments.
