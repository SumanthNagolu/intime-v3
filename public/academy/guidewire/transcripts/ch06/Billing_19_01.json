  "full_text": "This demonstration shows where to find security information in the BillingCenter user interface about users, roles, permissions, authority limits, groups, and security zones. In BillingCenter, security information is located on the Administration tab. Currently, I'm logged in as SuperUser, so I can see all the security details. We're interested in the entries listed under Users and Security in the sidebar. Let's start with Users and search for Jeff Park, whose username is jpark. I click Search. The results show a summary of Jeff's security information. We can see he has three roles and he belongs to the Operations group. I'll click Jeff's display name to see his details. Jeff Park security details are displayed on three tabs. Basics shows general information. Notice Jeff's password is masked. Jeff's user roles are listed at the bottom of the page. Let's look at Jeff's authority limits. At the top, we see Jeff's authority limit profile is that of SuperUser. So this list of authority limits are those belonging to the SuperUser authority limit profile. As we would expect of a Billing and Finance Manager, Jeff has consistently high authority limits, which means he can approve several types of transactions up to $1 million. I'll click the Profile tab next. The Profile tab provides user details such as address, phone numbers, and email. Let's return to the Basics tab to examine one of Jeff's roles. I'll click Finance Manager. A Finance Manager has five pages of permissions. Page 1 lists permissions to approve, assign, create, delete, and edit several entities. After scrolling down, I see the remainder of permissions on this page. Let's look at page 2. Page 2 lists more added permissions. A Finance Manager also has permissions to own, reassign, and search for entities. Earlier we saw that Jeff's authority limit profile is SuperUser. I'll click the authority limit profile link in the sidebar to see what other authority limit profiles are defined in our sample data. Here is the list of authority limit profiles. We have already seen the SuperUser profile. Let's take a look at the low authority limit profile. In contrast to SuperUser, someone with a low authority limit profile requires approval for transactions over $100. Let's return to the list of authority limit profiles. Now let's look at TLTest, which is a set of low limits for the purpose of load testing. The first thing I notice is that the TLTest profile in our sample data has only a handful of authority limits. An authority limit profile contains only those authority limits that are needed for a set of users. We have looked at a user, his roles, and authority limit profile. Now let's visit groups. Here we see the groups, their supervisor and their parent group. Jeff Park is the supervisor of the operations group, whose parent group is headquarters. You can see a three-level group hierarchy, commercial lines and personal lines have central billing as a parent, which in turn has headquarters as its parent. Group supervisors play a significant role during the tiered approval process, where each supervisor has greater approval authority than the supervisor of a group lower in the hierarchy. To find out who belongs to a group, simply click the group name. Let's look at personal lines. Here we see the personal lines group has three members. Its parent is central billing and it is associated with the personal lines zone security zone. Notice, a group can be associated with a maximum of one security zone. However, a user can belong to more than one group. In this way, the user can access entities that are in different security zones. I click the link to the personal lines zone. I'll click the security zones link to see a list of security zones in this system. As you can see, a security zone has a name and description. In your lab, you will have the opportunity to enroll entities in a security zone to see how security zones restrict access. This concludes our demonstration on viewing security information in the Billing Center user interface.
