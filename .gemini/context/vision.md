# Vision & Strategy: InTime v3

## The Concept: "Living Organism"
InTime is not traditional software. It is a **living organism** that thinks with your principles, learns from every interaction, grows with your business, extends your capabilities, and scales your impact.

## The 5 Pillars
1.  **Training Academy**: Transform candidates into consultants (8 weeks).
2.  **Recruiting Services**: 48-hour turnaround from JD to qualified candidates.
3.  **Bench Sales**: 30-60 day placement for bench consultants.
4.  **Talent Acquisition**: Pipeline building and outreach.
5.  **Cross-Border Solutions**: International talent facilitation.

## Core Principles
1.  **Quality over Speed**: "Best, only the best, nothing but the best."
2.  **Student Success = Job Placement**: Not just certifications.
3.  **Cross-Pollination**: Every interaction has 5+ business opportunities.
4.  **Data Ownership**: Complete control of all business data.
5.  **Scalability**: Design for 10x growth from day one (Pod model).

## Business Model: The Pod Structure
-   **2-Person Pods**: Senior + Junior pairs.
-   **Target**: 2 placements per 2-week sprint per pod.
-   **AI Role**: AI handles 95% of routine tasks; humans provide strategic guidance.

## Long-Term Vision
-   **2026**: Internal Operating System ($3M Revenue).
-   **2027**: B2B SaaS "IntimeOS" ($10M Revenue).
-   **2030**: IPO Preparation ($250M+ Revenue).
